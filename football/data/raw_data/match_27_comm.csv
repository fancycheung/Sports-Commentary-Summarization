0,7.15pm,Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us as we bring you live coverage of Real Madrid's last-16 clash with Sevilla at the Santiago Bernabeu. This represents both sides' first game of the new year and concludes the Spanish winter break.
1,7.17pm,"Both sides enjoyed a prosperous 2016 and none more so than Real, who now find themselves unbeaten in a total of 37 games. Zinedine Zidane's men are also coming off the back of another triumph at the FIFA Club World Cup over the winter period."
2,7.21pm,"Los Blancos have already beaten Sevilla once this season in the UEFA Super Cup back in August, but Jorge Sampaoli's charges have enjoyed a fruitful period in La Liga this season. As it stands, the current Europa League champions hold third position in the league standings - trailing just Real and second-placed Barcelona."
3,7.21pm,"There has been much talk in the build-up to this contest about how exactly Zidane plans to treat this match, especially given that his side will face Sevilla again in the second leg of this tie as well as in the league in a couple of weeks. What we do know is that main man Cristiano Ronaldo has been left out of the squad tonight, with some suggesting that his coach wants to ensure that the Portuguese star is free from any potential muscle strain ahead of the club's return to La Liga action."
4,7.24pm,"The hosts are also to be without Sergio Ramos and the injured trio of Lucas Vazquez, Mateo Kovacic and Gareth Bale, while Pepe is also struggling to make his way back into the side after an injury absence."
5,7.25pm,Time for the full team news now...
6,7.26pm,"REAL MADRID STARTING XI: Casilla; Carvajal, Varane, Nacho, Marcelo; Casemiro, Modric, Asensio, Kroos, James; Morata"
7,7.27pm,"REAL MADRID SUBSTITUTES: Navas, Benzema, Coentrao, Mariano, Isco, Danilo, Odegaard"
8,7.27pm,"SEVILLA STARTING XI: Rico; Mariano, Rami, Mercado, Escudero; N'Zonzi, Iborra, Nasri, Ganso, Vitolo; Correa"
9,7.28pm,"SEVILLA SUBSTITUTES: Kranevitter, Vietto, Ben Yedder, Kiyotake, Sarabia, Pareja, Sirigu"
10,7.29pm,"As expected, both Ramos and Pepe miss out, leaving Raphael Varane and Nacho to lead from the back. Alvaro Morata has been elected to lead the line on his own this evening, leaving a five-man midfield that makes use of an influential three in the shape of Toni Kroos, Casemiro and Luka Modric. James Rodriguez and youngster Marco Asensio also start and will be expected to provide much of the attacking support to line striker Morata."
11,7.32pm,"Madrid's bench is looking rather strong this evening as Zidane will be able to call on the likes of Karim Benzema, Isco and Danilo if his side finds itself in trouble. Given Ronaldo's absence, the club have in turn called up Martin Odegaard to the senior side and he too features on the sidelines."
12,7.34pm,"As for the visitors, Sampaoli has opted for strength from the off. The Sevilla coach has made a vast number of changes from the side that beat Formentera 9-1 before the winter break, as Sergio Rico, Samir Nasri, Steven N'Zonzi and Vitolo all make a return to the starting XI. The away side have retained the qualities of Adil Rami, Vicente Iborra, Ganso and Joaquin Correa. Wissam Ben Yedder and Luciano Vietto impressed before the break, but they both find themselves on the bench this evening."
13,7.42pm,"Today marks Zidane's first full year in the job at Real and he will be delighted with the way things have panned out so far this season. His side currently sit at the top of the La Liga table with a game in hand over Barcelona. He will, however, want to banish the club's recent torrid memories in this competition after they were thrown out of the tournament last campaign. Los Blancos do have a proud tradition in this tournament, though, having won the cup 19 times and Zidane will be keen to make it a 20th this season."
14,7.47pm,"Sevilla, who have won this competition five times, last proved triumphant back in 2010. They were denied in the final last year by Barcelona, but have found themselves in great form at the turn of the year. Sampaoli's men have won their last three games having beaten Celta Vigo, Malaga and Formentera during December 2016."
15,7.51pm,"Both sides found their last-32 fixtures equally easy to navigate. Real produced a resounding 13-2 aggregate win over Cultural Leonesa, while Sevilla overcame minnows Formentera 9-1."
16,7.51pm,Here's some quick footage of the players arriving at the ground a little earlier this evening:üöçüö∂üëã #RMCopa¬°Los jugadores han llegado al Bernab√©u!#HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/Z8axrO4POs‚Äî Real Madrid C. F. (@realmadrid) 4 January 2017 
17,7.56pm,"Much of Sevilla's league success this season has been based around the finish abilities of Luciano Vietto and Ben Yedder, although they both find themselves on the bench tonight given the club's looming clash with Real Sociedad at the weekend. Nasri, Vitolo and Iborra have proved clinical in front of goal too and they could be the ones to make the difference for the visitors tonight."
18,7.58pm,"If Sevilla are to get something out of this game they will surely be looking to exploit the Real defence, who are missing the influence of both Ramos and Pepe. They do, however, have rather special replacements in the form of Varane and Nacho who have more than proven their worth at the Bernabeu under Zidane."
19,8.00pm,"Steven N'Zonzi will be another key figure for Sevilla away from home. Such have been the importance of the Frenchman's performances for the club this campaign, the midfielder has reportedly garnered interest from Manchester City in recent months."
20,8.02pm,"Regardless of those sitting it out for Madrid here, Zidane's side has more than enough quality to gain the upper-hand during this first leg. The Real boss will be delighted at being able to field his crucial midfield-three of Kroos, Modric and Casemiro, they're essentially the engine room of this Madrid outfit."
21,8.04pm,Weather conditions aren't the best in Madrid at the moment. Things are looking rather foggy with temperatures around seven degrees. We might be expecting a little bit of rain too throughout the night.
22,8.05pm,"PREDICTION! We've got just under 10 minutes until kickoff now and it is time for me to make a prediction. Despite the number of key men missing from this Madrid side, they will expect to get themselves in front on home soil. Zidane's side look strong even without the presence of Bale, Ronaldo and company and will be eager to get the job done after a comfortable winter break. I'm backing the hosts to win this fixture 2-1..."
23,8.10pm,"The ground is filling up nicely ahead of kickoff, not long now:‚öΩÔ∏èüí™üôå #RMCopa¬°El calentamiento ya est√° en marcha!#HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/0Rkwlx60T8‚Äî Real Madrid C. F. (@realmadrid) 4 January 2017 "
24,8.15pm,Just a few seconds to go now. The players are linked by arm around the centre circle as we await the start of the contest.
25,1 min,"KICKOFF! Here we go then, Madrid kick things off moving from left to right. The hosts feature in all white, while the visitors are all in red this evening."
26,2 min,Not the tidiest of starts from the home side who are thwarted early on by Sevilla's high press. Casemiro has to put in some early shift work in order to break down a well-constructed attack started by Vitolo.
27,3 min,"CHANCE! Real should be in front really... Nacho moves the ball nicely into Carvajal, who then feeds Modric down the right channel. The former Tottenham Hotspur man produces a teasing ball towards the near post, where Morata scrambles clear of his marker before stabbing the ball wide of Rico's post."
28,4 min,"The visitors are unmoved by that chance and they aim to carve out something of their own. Ganso moves swiftly down the left before shifting the ball into the path of Correa. The youngster takes a few touches and then cuts inside, where he sees his curling effort deflected away for a corner off the outstretched Varane."
29,6 min,"Real are starting to warm up slightly... Asensio does brilliantly on the left wing to get the better of his marker, but his cut-back to Kroos sees the German produce an almost-perfect air-kick and Sevilla are able to scramble the ball away from danger."
30,8 min,The hosts have settled into proceedings nicely after an energetic start from their opponents. It'll be interesting to see how quickly the pace of this game moves forward after both sides having a break over Christmas.
31,9 min,"Sevilla won't be too put off by this early period of dominance from Real. Given the visitors' pressing skills, they'll be looking to use the counter to good effect in this contest."
32,11 min,GOAL! REAL MADRID 1-0 SEVILLA (JAMES RODRIGUEZ)
33,12 min,"And just as I say that... Wonderful pressing work from Casemiro who is able to rob Mercado on the edge of the Sevilla box. The midfielder then lays possession off to James, who turns and heads towards goal. The Colombian still has a lot of work to do, but is able to use Rami as the perfect shield as he bends a standout finish down beyond the reaches of Rico in the visiting goal. Incredible finishing from the former AS Monaco man."
34,14 min,"The hosts are full of confidence now and Marcelo takes charge of the next attack. The left-back bullets down the left flank before threading a ball back into the path of Morata. Luckily for Sevilla, the frontman slips and Rami can scramble the ball away."
35,15 min,"CLOSE! More enterprise down the right this time sees the ball lofted into Modric inside the box. The playmaker does brilliantly to get up and produce an overhead kick, which flies just a few inches wide of the far post. What a goal that would have been..."
36,18 min,"Sampaoli might be a little concerned at the moment. His side started brightly, but the hosts have been quick to every mistake in order to win the ball back. Asensio does the pressing this time and he wins the ball before moving swiftly down the left. The youngster picks out a ball for Morata in the area, but Rico comes out smartly to claim the cross."
37,21 min,"For the first time Sevilla are able to put their collective foot on the ball after a dominant opening from Real. Correa produces some neat work over on the right channel, but he is thwarted by Marcelo who is forced to concede a corner. The ball into the box is delivered by Ganso, although his cross evades the visiting frontline."
38,25 min,"Another promising moment now as Vitolo shows some brilliant movement to get beyond Carvajal, who crunches into his opponent just outside of the area. The whole ground thinks that it's a free kick, but the referee shakes his head and waves play on."
39,26 min,"YELLOW CARD! Ganso shows his frustration by kicking out at Carvajal, who goes down without too much encouragement in order to earn his side a free kick and an early booking for his opponent."
40,28 min,"Madrid are slowly starting to reassert themselves after 20-odd minutes here. The ball is worked meticulously on the outskirts of the Sevilla box, where Kroos finally loses patience before lashing a wild effort wide of the target from around 25 yards out."
41,29 min,"ALMOST! Fantastic build-up work from the hosts... Carvajal does well to work the ball into the path of James, who flights the ball to the back-post where Marcelo forces a corner following a stunning save from Rico."
42,29 min,GOAL! REAL MADRID 2-0 SEVILLA (RAPHAEL VARANE)
43,30 min,"What are Sevilla thinking? Rico does so well to keep out a strong effort from Marcelo, but from the resulting corner the defence simply go to sleep and allow Madrid to double their lead. Varane is allowed to advance unmarked inside the box and he simply leaps up into the air to head beyond a helpless Rico in the away goal. There wasn't a defender in sight there."
44,33 min,"Sevilla are presented with the chance to test the Madrid defence as Varane gives away a free kick on the left. Nasri delivers into the middle, where Ganso loops a tame head high and wide beyond the Madrid goal without troubling Casilla. The away side need to take all the chances they can get at the moment."
45,35 min,"Great work from Nasri on the left wing. The playmaker finds himself some room before feeding a perfectly-timed pass into the run of Correa, who finds space inside the area. Luckily for Real, Nacho gets across in the nick of time to deny the frontman the chance to test Casilla."
46,37 min,"Sevilla fans will be encouraged by this current spell, Madrid haven't exactly been hanging on but the visitors have looked increasingly more creative by the minute."
47,40 min,"Sevilla are finishing this half well, but you have to wonder why it has taken them this long to wake up. Madrid are well-placed at the moment and will be aiming to use the counter. Vitolo makes the most of some rising visiting pressure as he breaks beyond the home defence, but Casilla is quick off his line to clear up the danger."
48,43 min,PENALTY TO REAL MADRID!
49,44 min,GOAL! REAL MADRID 3-0 SEVILLA (JAMES RODRIGUEZ)
50,45 min,"A very odd decision from the referee here. The ball is turned into the Sevilla box, where Modric goes down under some apparent pressure from Mariano. On second look, James seems to have pushed Mariano, leading the defender to fall into Modric and send the Madrid man to the deck. Anyway, the referee gives a penalty, leaving James to slot home his second of the night after sending Rico the wrong way."
51,45+1 min,HALF TIME: REAL MADRID 3-0 SEVILLA
52,9.04pm,"So the referee brings a halt to a very entertaining first half of football in the Spanish capital. Madrid definitely deserve to be in front given the run of play, but Sevilla haven't exactly made it difficult for Zidane's men. The visitors started brightly with some keen high pressing, but that pressure soon faded and has allowed Madrid to exert control on the contest. James has been brilliant so far and is full value for his two goals, while Casemiro's industry in the middle has made all the difference thus far."
53,9.15pm,"What can Sevilla do to save this contest in the second half? Finding a goal would be a decent start, but they will need to be careful to ensure that this tie isn't completely beyond them before the second leg has even kicked off."
54,45 min,KICKOFF! Sevilla get us back underway here in Madrid. Can they find a route back into this contest? We still have a game and half's worth of football to play really...
55,47 min,"Not much to write home about in these opening minutes of the second half... Madrid have been looking to invite some pressure and look for the breakaway. Marcelo does just that before swinging a ball into the feet of Morata. The frontman has all the time in the world to find a finish beyond Rico, but he scuffs his effort and Sevilla clear."
56,49 min,Sarabia was introduced during the break and it will be interesting to see what impact he can make from midfield. Things have turned slightly scrappy here in the second half as both sides aim to find their footing again.
57,52 min,"Great strength from Nacho to deny the run of Correa. Madrid use the interception to break forward through Kroos, but the move falls apart just as it reaches the feet of Casemiro. Brilliant one-touch stuff from the hosts."
58,56 min,"CLOSE! The hosts are playing with some intensity now... Carvajal presses wonderfully to steal the ball before threading it into the path of Marcelo. The full-back whips a cross into the area, where Morata is only able to get a tame foot to the ball and the chance passes. You get the impression that these men are totally willing to put themselves on the line for Zizou."
59,59 min,"Sevilla haven't quite given this up just yet. The ball is stolen from Kroos in the middle of the park and is then fed in behind for the run of Correa. The youngster does well to beat the grasp oh Nacho, only for Casilla to spring off his line and hoof clear."
60,62 min,"Proceedings have begun to open up now as Sevilla aim to find a way back into this tie. Madrid are keeping patient at the moment and will likely be waiting for the gaps to appear in the visitors' midfield. The next goal, if we are to get another tonight, will likely play a major role in deciding who is going to be appearing in that quarter-final berth."
61,67 min,"This game has threatened to hot up in the past few moments, but things have fallen away slightly as Madrid aim to keep possession inside the Sevilla half. Sevilla can't quite make things work when they do finally get hold of the ball. This tie is slowly drifting away from them."
62,72 min,"Marcelo has been excellent this evening and he almost makes Sevilla pay on the left. James produces some memorable recovery work to reclaim the ball. The pass finds Marcelo on the left of the box, but his stinging effort is deflected wide by Mariano."
63,75 min,"Sampaoli is still trying to orchestrate things from his dugout, but the visitors don't seem to have enough going forward to threaten Madrid as things stand. The visiting coach will be happy that they haven't conceded a fourth, though..."
64,80 min,"We're now into the final 10 minutes of the contest here in Madrid. A late goal could mean everything for the visitors. As things stand, Madrid are well and truly in the driving seat going into the second leg."
65,84 min,"Nothing giving at the moment in terms of this Madrid defence - they look totally resolute. The home side are happy to sit back at the moment and wait for the opportunity to go on the counter. That's been much the pattern of this second half, we haven't seen too much in front of goal at all to be honest. This game has been largely won and lost in the first 45 minutes."
66,85 min,"CLOSE! Casemiro has been outstanding in this fixture and he nearly caps off his performance with a standout assist. The midfielder sends a 40-odd yard lofted ball over the defence into the path of Danilo, but Rico makes a strong save down low to deny the full-back."
67,89 min,"Madrid are still working intensely out there to press the away side. They've shown nothing but total dedication to fight for their manager, who has now guided his side to 38 games unbeaten. That's a pretty outstanding record for such an inexperienced coach at this level."
68,90+1 min,We're going to have three minutes of additional time here...
69,90+3 min,FULL TIME: REAL MADRID 3-0 SEVILLA
70,10.08pm,"There we have it then, the referee calls time on an uneventful second half in Spain. Madrid will be delighted with that 3-0 win and fully deserved the victory. As for Sevilla, the visitors essentially gave this tie up during the first half and they will be livid at that. Sampaoli's men left it far too late to put up a challenge and they will need something pretty special in the second leg in order to turn this tie around. Thank you for joining us this evening, that's all from me tonight!"
