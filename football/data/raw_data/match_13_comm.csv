0,2.15pm,Hello and welcome to Sports Mole's live text commentary of today's La Liga game between Barcelona and Malaga!
1,2.17pm,"The Catalan giants are back at the Camp Nou after the international break in search of a win and, with the help of Atletico Madrid later on Saturday evening, a chance to return to the top of La Liga ahead of arch-rivals Real Madrid."
2,2.20pm,"Malaga, managed by Juande Ramos, stand in the Blaugrana's way, and they are in decent form, winning four of their last seven matches to climb into the top half of the table."
3,2.22pm,"Without further ado, let's get the team news, and there are some bad news for Barca I'm afraid..."
4,2.24pm,"BARCELONA STARTING XI: Ter Stegen, Pique, Sergio, Denis, Arda, Neymar, Rafinha, Mascherano, Alcacer, Digne, Sergi Roberto"
5,2.25pm,"MALAGA STARTING XI: Kameni, Rosales, Torres, Mikel, Ricca, Llorente, Pablo, Ontiveros, Juankar, Juanpi, Sandro"
6,2.26pm,"BARCA SUBSTITUTES: Cillessen, Rakitic, Alba, Gomes, Vidal, Alena, Marlon"
7,2.27pm,"MALAGA SUBSTITUTES: Boyko, Santos, Castro, Duda, Jony, En-Nesyri, Munoz"
8,2.28pm,"So the bad news for Barcelona is that Lionel Messi, the prodigal son of the Camp Nou, is not in the squad for today's game. According to the official Blaugrana feed, he is unwell with vomiting.[BREAKING NEWS] Leo #Messi is unwell with vomiting and will not be available for today's game #FCBLive pic.twitter.com/jjSbqd6jO7‚Äî FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) 19 November 2016"
9,2.29pm,"The hosts are already missing the suspended Luis Suarez, so they are now without two of their best players. Just the ""N"" in ""MSN"" today - will Malaga seize the opportunity?"
10,2.32pm,"All in all Luis Enrique makes four changes to his side from their 2-1 win over Sevilla a fortnight ago, with Arda Turan given a chance in Messi's place and Paco Alcacer replacing Suarez. Elsewhere in the formation, Samuel Umtiti and Ivan Rakitic make way for Gerard Pique and Rafinha respectively."
11,2.35pm,"As for Malaga, Juande Ramos makes three changes to his starting XI from the line-up that defeated Sporting Gijon 3-2 two weeks ago. Federico Ricca, Diego Llorente and Javi Ontiveros are drafted into the team in place of Ignacio Camacho, who is serving a one-match suspension after receiving his fifth yellow of the campaign, as well as Chory Castro and Jhony, who make the bench."
12,2.38pm,"Alongside Messi's illness and Suarez's suspension, Andres Iniesta remains sidelined with a knee injury. Obviously there is still plenty of quality in the Barcelona squad and, on paper, should have more than enough to see off Malaga, but this is a ""depleted"" Blaugrana side if ever there was one."
13,2.41pm,"As it stands, Barca are second in the La Liga table, two points behind league leaders Real Madrid. The Catalans have the earlier fixture, so if they beat Malaga, they will leapfrog Los Blancos at the summit and pile the pressure onto their bitter rivals."
14,2.45pm,"Real are in action at 7:45pm GMT tonight, and the fixture is arguably one of the toughest of the season - city rivals Atletico Madrid at the Vicente Calderon."
15,2.47pm,"In addition, the Atletico-Real clash could be the last derby at the Vicente Calderon, as Los Colchoneros are due to move to the Estadio Olimpico de Madrid in the summer. Added motivation for Diego Simeone's boys to sign off with a derby win? Either way, Barca players and fans will be keenly watching - or listening to, or otherwise following - tonight's game in the Spanish capital."
16,2.50pm,"Don't assume that Malaga will be pushovers, though. The Andalusians have won four of their last seven matches to climb into the top half of the table, sitting 10th at the present moment, and will be hoping to spring a surprise victory against a Barca side missing key players."
17,2.53pm,"Also, Malaga have a decent record against the Catalans in recent years. They won 1-0 at the Camp Nou two seasons ago before following that up with a goalless draw at home. Barcelona only beat them by a single strike in their two matches last term, so it could be interesting."
18,2.56pm,"Another day, another impressive milestone for a member of Barcelona's all-conquering squad of the last decade.üîùüëè With today's game against M√°laga, Sergio Busquets now reaches 400 appearances in a Bar√ßa shirt #For√ßaBar√ßa pic.twitter.com/65z4yqmiSR‚Äî FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) 19 November 2016"
19,2.59pm,"The absence of Messi is certainly a concern for the Barca hierarchy, staff and fans, in what could be a recurrence of him falling sick during a flight to San Juan ahead of Argentina's crunch game with Colombia during the international break."
20,3.02pm,"According to reports, Messi had to be treated by doctors for travel sickness on the plane but appeared to have made a recovery, subsequently playing for the Albiceleste against Colombia."
21,3.05pm,"Messi is also in the news because of reported issues over his future - his contract is until 2018 and he has not yet put pen to paper on a new deal, so speculation on whether he will stay at the Camp Nou or seek pastures new is in overdrive."
22,3.08pm,"Luis Enrique has sought to reassure fans by suggesting that Messi is in for the long haul. He told the official club website: ""I imagine Lionel Messi will be at Barcelona for many years. It would be nice that a player who leaves his country to come to Barcelona and to be number one in history ends up finishing his career here. I would like that, but it's up to him."""
23,3.10pm,"PREDICTION: With just five minutes until kickoff, it's time for me to speculate on what the final result will be - although Barca are missing three of their key players, they are in great form and should still be too strong for Malaga. I predict 3-0 to the hosts, with Neymar bagging either a brace or a hat-trick."
24,3.12pm,"There has already been a game today in La Liga as Sevilla came from 2-0 down at Deportivo La Coruna to win 3-2, with Gabriel Mercado scoring an injury-time winner. The result takes them up to third, above Villarreal and Atletico Madrid, and just three points off the top."
25,0 min,KICKOFF! We are underway at the Camp Nou as referee Ricardo de Burgos blows his whistle to kick things off!
26,2 min,Barcelona are on the front foot straight away as Neymar wins a throw-in deep into Malaga's half.
27,3 min,"DISALLOWED GOAL! Alcacer has the ball in the back of the Malaga net, but Mascherano's chipped ball over the top was a tad too slow and the goal is correctly ruled out for offside."
28,6 min,"Barcelona are settling into the game early and have had most of the possession, with Malaga happy to defend and keeping most of their men behind the ball."
29,8 min,"Sandro ventures into opposition territory down the right flank but, with virtually no support, he opts to try his luck towards goal, and the ball flies harmlessly wide."
30,10 min,"CHANCE! The returning Pique lofts a pass over the top of the Malaga defence for Neymar, who controls and half-volleys towards goal with his weaker foot, but the Brazilian's effort only goes as far as the side netting."
31,12 min,"CHANCES! The hosts are piling on the pressure as Sergi Roberto plays in Alcacer, who rifles his shot wide when it looked easier to score, and moments later, Barca win a corner which Neymar plays into the path of Pique, whose strike is thwarted by Kameni."
32,13 min,OFF THE POST! Mascherano latches on to a Pique flick but fires his close-range shot against the post. It would have been offside anyway.
33,16 min,"Denis Suarez goes for goal with an effort from outside the area, but doesn't hit the ball properly and sends it yards wide of the left post."
34,18 min,"A Neymar pass finds its way to Arda on the right-hand side, but the Turkey international's left-footed shot is weak and gets cleared with ease."
35,21 min,"Barca keep piling on the pressure, with Rafinha trying his luck after latching on to Arda's lay-off, but his effort from distance flies wide."
36,22 min,"BOOKING: Ricca catches Arda with an elbow as the pair raise to meet the ball, and the former is shown a yellow for his troubles."
37,24 min,"CHANCE! And it falls to Malaga this time as Neymar gives the ball away poorly in midfield and Sandro bursts through into the final third. The ex-Barca man lets rip from about 25 yards, but Ter Stegen is equal to it and saves to his left."
38,26 min,"Another error at the back from Barca as Busquets very nearly gifts Sandro a route through on goal, only for Pique to intervene and make a last-ditch tackle."
39,29 min,"Pique peels away from his marker and gets on the end of a corner kick, but he sends his header straight at the goalkeeper."
40,31 min,"CHANCE! Great work from Malaga keeper Kameni, who pulls off a great save to keep out Rafinha's deflected shot. He had to change his body position and get down low to keep the diverted effort out."
41,34 min,"Denis Suarez whips the ball into danger territory, but it fails to reach any of his teammates as the visiting defence clears the threat."
42,37 min,Just under 10 minutes to go in this first half and the action has settled. Malaga have weathered the storm and are now enjoying a few ambitious forays of their own. Still goalless.
43,40 min,Neymar gives the ball away again but does well to win it back as Barca force a corner on the right-hand side - Malaga clear with ease though.
44,43 min,"Digne gets the ball over to Busquets, but the latter strikes a wild shot from the edge of the box which sails over the Malaga bar."
45,45 min,"Digne marauds down the left and plays the ball to Rafinha, who flashes it across the face of goal but proves too heavy for Arda, who tries to appeal for a penalty, but nothing is given. One minute of injury time given."
46,45+2 min,HALF TIME: BARCELONA 0-0 MALAGA
47,4.02pm,"It's been a pretty eventful first half in terms of chances, pressure and individual mistakes, but aside from one booking for the visitors, not much has happened to fill the highlight reel. It remains goalless between Barcelona and Malaga at the break."
48,4.05pm,"Luis Enrique's side started the match well enough and looked like taking the lead on a number of occasions in the opening quarter-hour. However, as the first period wore on, the hosts found it harder to break down the visitors."
49,4.08pm,"With Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez missing today, the responsibility in terms of providing a little magic has fallen to Neymar, but he has not quite delivered in the first 45 minutes. Average in attack, and also responsible for a few misplaced passes which could have proven dangerous."
50,4.11pm,"Barcelona's best chance fell to Rafinha, who very nearly wrongfooted Carlos Kameni with a deflected shot, but the 32-year-old recovered well to get down and get a strong right hand to deny the home side from taking the lead."
51,4.13pm,"As for Paco Alcacer, he has once again not impressed in the Blaugrana shirt today, so it remains to be seen whether Luis Enrique will call on some of the younger players in his squad for the second half to try and get all three points."
52,4.15pm,"So can Barcelona leapfrog Real Madrid and put pressure on their arch-rivals ahead of their city derby later today, or will they lose ground in the title race? Stay with Sports Mole and we'll give you all the action from the Camp Nou as it unfolds!"
53,46 min,KICKOFF: We're back underway as Ricardo de Burgos's whistle ushers in the second 45 minutes of this La Liga clash.
54,47 min,"Neymar breaks free and prepares to take a shot, but Mikel stretches out a leg and nicks the ball away from the Brazilian."
55,50 min,"CHANCE! Neymar collects the ball on the left-hand touchline and beats two players cutting inside, but his subsequent effort is straight into Kameni's arms."
56,52 min,"Rafinha unlocks Malaga's defence with a chipped ball over the top and Neymar goes for the header, but it's flagged for offside."
57,54 min,"PENALTY APPEAL! Arda wins a header inside the Malaga box and goes to ground under pressure from Ricca, but the ref signals for a free kick to the visitors."
58,57 min,"CHANCE! Probably Malaga's best effort of the match as Juanpi plays the ball through for Juankar, who rounds Ter Stegen in the Barca goal, but under pressure from the oncoming Mascherano, he fires his shot wide of the post."
59,59 min,"Rafinha, one of Barca's liveliest players this afternoon, sees a shot deflected out for a corner."
60,62 min,"BOOKING: Neymar gets the better of two Malaga players but is hacked down just outside the area by Ontiveros, who goes into the referee's book for his troubles."
61,63 min,SUBSTITUTION: Lucas Digne's afternoon on the pitch is over as Luis Enrique opts to replace him with Jordi Alba.
62,65 min,"Llorente and Pique clash again in the Malaga box as the Barca defender gets the header away but Kameni saves well, before the referee lets the visitors off the hook by whistling for a foul."
63,67 min,"A bit of a lull now as Barcelona enjoy possession, exchanging pass after pass and waiting for an opportunity to strike against a defiant Malaga defence."
64,68 min,SUBSTITUTION: Luis Enrique makes his second change of the afternoon and it's Andre Gomes who comes on for Denis Suarez.
65,69 min,"RED CARD! Neymar once again beats two players in midfield and breaks through on goal before being scythed down by Llorente, who is shown a straight red card by the referee."
66,70 min,SUBSTITUTION: Javier Ontiveros goes off the pitch for the visitors and Luis Munoz comes on in his place.
67,72 min,"Rafinha reacts well near the penalty spot to connect with an inswinging corner, but his header sails high over the Malaga bar."
68,74 min,"Neymar continues to torment the Malaga defence, now a man down, with a cheeky flick over the head of Rosales, but is eventually crowded out before he can get the cross in."
69,77 min,"SUBSTITUTION: In their final change of the day, Barcelona bring on Ivan Rakitic for Rafinha in midfield."
70,78 min,"Neymar wins a free kick just outside the Malaga area and opts to take it himself, but his shot flies high over the bar."
71,80 min,"CHANCE! Rakitic floats a ball into the area towards Pique, who has been shifted up front, and the defender-by-trade fails to direct his header towards goal."
72,82 min,SUBSTITUTION: Malaga bring off former Barca striker Sandro and Moroccan teenager Youssef En-Nesyri comes on for the final eight minutes plus stoppages.
73,84 min,DISALLOWED GOAL! And once again Malaga get out of jail after Gomes strikes the post and Pique turns the rebound home - the makeshift striker is flagged for offside!
74,85 min,"PENALTY APPEAL! Barca are not knocking on the door so much as violently shoulder-barging the woodwork - Pique is hauled down by Villanueva inside the area, prompting the Camp Nou home faithful to roar ahead of a seemingly imminent penalty, but once again the referee waves play on!"
75,89 min,"The Barca fans are not happy as opposition goalkeeper Kameni, once of Espanyol, goes down injured and demands treatment."
76,90 min,The officials indicate four minutes of added time at the Camp Nou.
77,90+3 min,CHANCE! A great save by Kameni as Neymar's diving header is followed up by a leap across goal by the Malaga stopper to keep the ball out.
78,90+5 min,"SUBSTITUTION: The final change of the day for Malaga who, in a bid to waste a little more time, remove Pablo Fornals and bring on Duda."
79,90+6 min,RED CARD! Malaga are down to NINE men as Juankar receives a straight red card for complaining to the referee about the amount of added time!
80,90+8 min,FULL TIME: BARCELONA 0-0 MALAGA
81,5.10pm,"So it's all over at the Camp Nou and Malaga, who have been somewhat of a bogey team for Barcelona over the years, depart with a point!"
82,5.11pm,"Luis Enrique's charges were not quite at their peak, given the absence of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Andres Iniesta. This, combined with a determined and physical Malaga side who also had a lot of luck on their side, ensures that the Blaugrana do not leapfrog Real Madrid to the La Liga summit."
83,5.12pm,That's all we have time for today but stay with Sports Mole as we bring you match reports and reaction from this and all the other big games of the day! Thank you for following and have a great rest of the weekend!
