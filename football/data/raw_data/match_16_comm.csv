0,6.46pm,"Evening all! Sports Mole's live La Liga coverage continues from Camp Nou as the champions Barcelona welcome rock-bottom Granada, who are still without a win this season. This should be a very straightforward night for Lionel Messi & Co. Stay tuned right here to find out what occurs!"
1,6.49pm,"The state of play at the top of La Liga currently looks like this - Real Madrid are top of the table on 24 points after a 4-1 win over Alaves earlier this afternoon. As it stands, Atletico Madrid are heading second on 21 points courtesy of a win over Malaga (Diego Simeone's side lead 3-1 in the second period). Meanwhile, Sevilla have dropped to third on 21 points after a 1-1 draw with Sporting Gijon this afternoon. Barcelona currently have 19 points and sit in fourth spot in the table."
2,6.52pm,"In terms of the recent meetings between Barcelona and Granada, it will not come as much of a surprise to learn that the champions have been extremely dominant. Indeed, they won 4-0 at home and 3-0 away when the pair clashed in the league last season and have actually scored 14 times in their last three home league fixtures with Granada. It could well be another high-scoring game here!"
3,6.55pm,"Right, without further ado, let me bring you up-to-speed with the all-important team news from Camp Nou. Barcelona lost 1-0 to Espanyol in the Supercopa de Catalunya on Tuesday night, but it was very much an experimental XI. Have all the big guns returned here? Let's run through the two XIs...© SilverHub"
4,6.58pm,"TEAMS!FCB: Ter Stegen; Roberto, Umtiti, Mascherano, Digne; Rafinha, Rakitic, Denis; Neymar, Suarez, MessiGRANADA: Ochoa; Uche, Saunier, Vezo, Lomban, Silva; Pereira, Carcela-Gonzalez, Toral, Cuenca; Kravets"
5,7.02pm,"No real surprises in the Barcelona XI tonight when considering the injuries for Luis Enrique. Arda Turan, Jordi Alba, Gerard Pique, Jeremy Mathieu and Andres Iniesta all miss out through injury, which means that a back four of Sergi Roberto, Samuel Umtiti, Javier Mascherano and Lucas Digne will start this match. Sergio Busquets is named on the bench, which allows Denis Suarez a chance to impress in the middle of the park. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar continue in the final third of the field."
6,7.05pm,"As for Granada, it appears that the visitors will line-up in a 5-4-1 formation tonight. On-loan Manchester United midfielder Andres Pereira keeps his spot in the selection, while Jon Toral, who is on loan from Arsenal, is also included. Six of the Granada XI tonight are actually on loan from other clubs, but experienced centre-back David Lomban and former Barcelona winger Isaac Cuenca keep their positions."
7,7.08pm,"So there we have it. The two teams are in and we are now just about 40 minutes from kickoff on this mild evening in Barcelona. I shall speak about the away side and their struggles a little bit later, but let's start with tonight's hosts. As mentioned, Luis Enrique's side currently sit fourth in La Liga on 19 points – five points behind the leaders Real Madrid, who won 4-1 at Alaves earlier this afternoon.© SilverHub"
8,7.12pm,"It is shaping up to be a very exciting season in Spain's top flight as Sevilla and Villarreal attempt to gatecrash the top three. Plenty of points have already been dropped this season and Atletico Madrid have actually conceded a second at home to Malaga in their top-flight contest. Little over five minutes left at the Calderon and Atletico, who are heading into second spot, lead 3-2."
9,7.15pm,"Barcelona opened their La Liga campaign with back-to-back victories over Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao, but then incredibly lost 2-1 at home to tiny Alaves. They responded with a win over Leganes, but were then held at home by Atletico Madrid. The champions have actually won three of their last four in the league, although that run includes a 4-3 defeat away at Celta Vigo."
10,7.18pm,"Barcelona were also extremely fortunate to emerge with all three points from their trip to Valencia last weekend. Los Che recovered from one goal behind to lead 2-1 early in the second period, but Suarez equalised just past the hour before Messi won it with a 94th-minute penalty. It was a sensational five-goal thriller at the Mestalla and the hosts deserved something for their efforts.© AFP"
11,7.21pm,"RESULT! Atletico have beaten Malaga 4-2 at the Vicente Calderon to rise into second position in the table. As a result, Barcelona have dropped down to fourth position. That said, any win for the home side tonight would take them second - two points behind the league leaders Real Madrid."
12,7.24pm,"Barcelona have actually scored eight times and conceded none in their last two home matches – a 4-0 win over Deportivo La Coruna in the league followed by a 4-0 success against Manchester City in the Champions League. Enrique's side are yet to find their best form this season though and they have suffered a number of injuries in recent weeks. Luckily Messi, Neymar and Suarez are all fit!"
13,7.27pm,"In terms of what is ahead for the Catalan giants, they will travel to Man City in the Champions League next week, before visiting impressive Sevilla in the league next weekend. Then comes a home league game against Malaga after the international break, before visiting Celtic in the Champions League. It is a very busy period for the Spanish champions, that is for sure.© SilverHub"
14,7.30pm,"As for Granada, a very difficult start to the campaign has left Lucas Alcaraz's side bottom of La Liga on three points. They have drawn three and lost six of their nine league fixtures this term – scoring just eight times and conceding 23 in the process. Indeed, they are already five points from safety and that could get worse by the time that the latest set of La Liga fixtures are completed."
15,7.33pm,"The Andalusian side opened their season with a 1-1 draw at home to Villarreal, but were then thumped 5-1 at Las Palmas and beaten 2-1 by Eibar on home soil. Their second point of the campaign came away at Real Betis on September 16, which was followed by a four-game losing run, which included a 7-1 defeat at Atletico Madrid. The last thing they need is another thumping tonight."
16,7.36pm,"Granada will enter this match off the back of a goalless draw with Sporting Gijon last weekend, which ended that losing run, but they are the only La Liga team yet to win a match this season. It is going to be very difficult to get a result in this match, but they host Deportivo La Coruna next weekend in a fixture that is absolutely massive, even at this early stage of the campaign.© Getty Images"
17,7.39pm,"El Grana returned to the top flight of Spanish football in 2011 after coming through the Segunda Division playoffs. Since then, they have finished 17th, 15th, 15th, 17th and 16th in La Liga, which is an indication of their struggles. They have managed to keep their heads above water in the last five campaigns, but that looks to be a very difficult task this time around. Right, kickoff is just around the corner here!"
18,7.42pm,"TEAMS!FCB: Ter Stegen; Roberto, Umtiti, Mascherano, Digne; Rafinha, Rakitic, Denis; Neymar, Suarez, MessiGRANADA: Ochoa; Uche, Saunier, Vezo, Lomban, Silva; Pereira, Carcela-Gonzalez, Toral, Cuenca; Kravets"
19,0 min,KICKOFF! Granada kick things off at Camp Nou...
20,2 min,"... Granada have visited Camp Nou on 22 occasions, and lost on 22 occasions. In truth, it is going to take a minor miracle for the away side to triumph tonight. But hey, surprises can happen."
21,2 min,"Decent work from Uche as the Granada midfielder turns inside the Barcelona box and drills the ball towards goal, but Ter Stegen makes the claim. It is pretty much a free hit for the visitors tonight, but they will want to avoid suffering a heavy defeat - they recently shipped seven at Atletico Madrid."
22,4 min,"Possession football from Barcelona as they pass and probe in the Granada half of the field. The visitors have managed to get through the opening four minutes without conceding, but the home side look intent on making the breakthrough in the early exchanges of this contest."
23,6 min,"Carcela-Gonzalez breaks through on the Barcelona goal and tests Ter Stegen with a strike, but the Granada midfielder had just moved into an offside position. Some early intent from Granada, which is very good to see. Barcelona are yet to test the away side's stopper - the well-travelled Mexican Ochoa."
24,8 min,"Half-chance for Messi as the Argentine meets a low cross from Neymar, but his effort deflects into the arms of Ochoa. No serious opportunities to speak about inside the opening eight minutes here."
25,11 min,"BOOKING! Gabriel (Granada) is booked following a heavy challenge on Roberto, which saw the Barcelona right-back land on his shoulder. That could have been a really bad one."
26,13 min,"Still no chances at Camp Nou, which is a surprise with 13 minutes on the clock. Lucas Alcaraz will be pretty pleased with what he has seen from his side in the early exchanges of this contest."
27,14 min,"Ochoa comes out to deny Neymar with his feet, but the Brazilian had just moved too soon and the offside flag was raised. Down the other end, Kravets and Pereira combine, only for the flag to be raised once again. Both linesman have been busy so far, but pretty straightforward decisions."
28,16 min,"The final pass is not quite there for Barcelona at the moment as Granada continue to clear their lines. It is taking a bit of time for the home side to find their rhythm, but I would be very surprised if this was not a comfortable home win. The attacks are starting to build at a swift pace here."
29,18 min,"Pass, pass, pass from Barcelona as they continue to look for openings in the final third, but Granada are remaining strong at the back as they clear their lines towards lone forward Kravets."
30,20 min,"Half-chance for the home side as Neymar curls one towards the far corner, but his effort was always dropping wide of the post. Still goalless with 20 minutes on the clock at Camp Nou."
31,22 min,"Messi looks to pick out Suarez with a chipped pass, but Ochoa is on hand to collect and the Granada goalkeeper can clear his lines once again. Not too much of an atmosphere inside the stadium, which is reflecting what has been a pretty lacklustre opening 22 minutes of action here."
32,24 min,"Another half-chance for the home side as Rakitic meets a cross from Messi, but his header was always moving wide of the post. That is all Barcelona have managed so far - half-chances."
33,26 min,Very subdued stadium at the moment as Granada remain pretty comfortable in this match.
34,28 min,"CHANCE! Suarez breaks through on goal and looks favourite to score, but two Granada defenders are back to make the challenge. Looked for all the world as if it would be 1-0 Barcelona!"
35,30 min,Barcelona have a free kick in a dangerous position outside of the Granada box...
36,31 min,... Messi strikes straight into the wall as Granada continue to frustrate the home side.
37,33 min,"I must be honest, I expected Barcelona to win by five or six tonight. That still might be the case, but Granada have been very good in the opening 33 minutes of this match. I was not sure that Granada had this type of performance in them, but they have been just brilliant at the back here."
38,34 min,Rafinha's long-range strike is deflected wide following a period of Barcelona possession.
39,36 min,"Little under 10 minutes of the first period remaining and the home supporters are doing their best to raise the atmosphere inside the stadium. The home side need a bit of a push at the moment and Suarez tests Ochoa with a strike from distance. That said, it was a pretty comfortable save."
40,39 min,"Pereira, on loan from Manchester United, is always available down the left for Granada and a better pass from Toral would have released the youngster in a wide position. It has been a very frustrating half for Barcelona, but all of the credit must go to the visitors. They have been excellent here."
41,41 min,"Hardly breaking news, but Barcelona are really missing Iniesta tonight. That ability to pick a pass from midfield has not really come from either Denis Suarez or Rakitic in this first period."
42,43 min,"Granada have the chance to break and Pereira delivers a super pass towards Kravets, but the striker just takes the ball too wide and Barcelona are able to get men behind the ball."
43,45 min,Granada win a free kick deep inside the Barcelona half as the half-time interval draws closer. It will be some achievement if the league's bottom side can hold the champions in this first period.
44,45 min+1,HALF-TIME: Barcelona 0-0 Granada
45,8.31pm,"Well then! The referee brings the first period at Camp Nou to a close with the two teams level at 0-0. Many expected Granada to be three or four goals behind at this stage, but Barcelona have been very lacklustre in the final third of the field. Clear chances have been at a premium tonight!"
46,8.36pm,"STATISTICS! Barcelona have utterly dominated the possession with 72%, while they have had six attempts, but just two of those were on target. Granada have not had a single attempt thus far, but their defensive work has been brilliant. Just the one booking - Granada's Silva in the 11th minute."
47,8.41pm,"BENCH WATCH! Barcelona do not have too much experience on their bench tonight, but Andre Gomes and Paco Alcacer are two players that could be introduced in the second period. Meanwhile, youngsters Alena, Nili and Marlon are also available for Enrique. As for Granada, head coach Alcaraz has options in the shape of Boga, David Barral and on-loan Barcelona midfielder Sergi Samper."
48,8.46pm,Neymar's face sums up Barcelona's first period...© SilverHub
49,46 min,RESTART! Barcelona resume the action on home soil...
50,47 min,"... no changes from either side at the break, which is not too much of a surprise. However, I suspect that both managers will already have alterations in mind for the second period. Surely Granada cannot hold out for another 45 minutes - can they? Be sure to stay tuned to find out!"
51,48 min,GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Granada (Rafinha)
52,49 min,"Oh my word! Barcelona almost mess up a brilliant chance as Neymar smashes the ball against the post from close range, but Rafinha finds the back of the net with a stunning over-head kick!"
53,51 min,"There has been a big improvement from Barcelona at the start of this second period and the football in the build-up to that opening goal was just brilliant. Rafinha has been in and out of the Barcelona team this season, but that was another brilliant goal from the very talented midfielder."
54,53 min,Possession football from the home side as they pass and probe in the final third of the field. Granada need to move on quickly from that opening goal or this game could get away from them.
55,55 min,Just a reminder that a win for Barcelona would take them into second position in the table - two points behind the leaders Real Madrid ahead of next weekend's trip to fourth-place Sevilla. The home supporters are in fine voice at the moment as they continue to drive their team forward.
56,57 min,Barcelona are playing a very high line at the moment and all it takes is for one Granada player to time their run. You still get the feeling that there might be something in this for the visitors.
57,59 min,"Little over 30 minutes of football remaining at Camp Nou and Rafinha's brilliant effort is the difference at the moment. It has been far from convincing from Barcelona, but they are heading into second spot in the table and that it all that matters. Granada are still very, very deep here."
58,60 min,GRANADA SUB! Pereira is replaced by on-loan Chelsea midfielder Boga.
59,62 min,"It is never nice to lose, but if this stays 1-0, Granada would have to be pleased with their work in this match. Many, myself included, expected them to suffer an absolute pasting at Camp Nou."
60,64 min,"SAVE! Neymar has the freedom of the Granada box and looks to fire home after collecting a cross from Roberto, but Ochoa is on hand to make a really smart save!"
61,66 min,"Granada continue to deal with the threat from Barcelona as Suarez is crowded out in a wide position. Still no movement on the home side's bench, but that is not much of a surprise. I should not think that we will see Alcacer tonight unless Barcelona score a couple of quick-fire goals."
62,67 min,"Boga breaks forward for Granada and Mascherano has to come across and block the midfielder's effort behind for a corner. At 1-0, basement club Granada will always be in this match."
63,70 min,Barcelona are preparing to make their first change of the match as Andre Gomes waits...
64,71 min,BARCELONA SUB! Gomes replaces Denis Suarez for the home side.
65,72 min,GRANADA SUB! Barral replaces Kravets in Granada's second change.
66,73 min,BOOKING! Toral (Granada) is booked for a late challenge on Neymar.
67,76 min,Just a reminder that Barcelona will travel to Man City in the Champions League on Tuesday night and therefore it is not too much of a surprise that the players are operating within themselves at the moment. The Spanish champions cannot afford to suffer any more injuries during this period.
68,77 min,"GRANADA SUB! Granada make their third change and it is a very interesting one as Sergi Samper, who is loan from Barcelona to Granada, replaces Toral. He has to score then!"
69,79 min,Granada have just come out of their shell in the last couple of minutes and Barcelona could be in for a difficult last 10 minutes of football at Camp Nou. The result is still far from certain here.
70,79 min,BOOKING! Lomban is booked for chopping Neymar just outside the box...
71,80 min,... Messi fires his set piece straight into the wall.
72,81 min,Barcelona are preparing to make their second change of the match here.
73,82 min,SAVE! Ochoa keeps out a close-range header from Suarez as Granada remain in this match entering the final 10 minutes of action. Alcacer is still on the touchline receiving instructions!
74,84 min,BARCELONA SUB! Alcacer replaces Suarez for the home side.
75,87 min,BOOKINGS! Neymar (Barcelona) and Vezo (Granada) are booked following a clash!
76,89 min,"Granada have the chance to send both centre-backs forward after forcing a free kick inside the Barcelona half of the field, but the set piece is poor and the home side manage to clear their lines."
77,90 min,"Messi attempts to chip Ochoa from close range, but misses the goal altogether as Granada remain one goal behind entering the final moments of this match. Still time for a late equaliser here!"
78,90 min+2,We are into the second of three additional minutes at Camp Nou.
79,90 min+3,"Not much to report in the closing minutes of this match as Barcelona keep hold of the possession. Granada are going to lose tonight, but they are going to lose with a brilliant performance."
80,90 min+4,FULL-TIME: Barcelona 1-0 Granada
81,9.41pm,"So there we have it. Barcelona run out narrow winners over Granada courtesy of a brilliant over-head kick from Rafinha early in the second period. It was not pretty, but the champions move into second spot in the table. That is just about it from me tonight. Thanks for joining us once again!"
