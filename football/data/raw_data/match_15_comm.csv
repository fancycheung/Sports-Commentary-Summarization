0,6.46pm,"Evening all! Sports Mole's live Champions League coverage continues from the Etihad Stadium as Manchester City welcome Barcelona in Group C. It is two weeks since the pair met at Camp Nou, when Barcelona recorded a 4-0 victory courtesy of a hat-trick from Lionel Messi and late Neymar strike. Can Man City gain some revenge tonight? Be sure stick with us for minute-by-minute updates from Manchester!"
1,6.49pm,"Tonight will be the sixth time that these two sides have clashed in European competition and Barcelona have triumphed on each occasion. Their first ever clash occurred in the round of 16 during the 2013-14 campaign and it was Barcelona that emerged 4-1 winners on aggregate, which included a 2-0 success in Manchester - Messi and Dani Alves scoring the goals for the Spanish side."
2,6.52pm,They then locked horns in the quarter-finals of the 2014-15 campaign and Barcelona recorded a 2-1 victory in Manchester before winning 1-0 at home courtesy of a sole strike from Ivan Rakitic. It has been one-way traffic in his fixture and it promises to be another tough night for Man City as Pep Guardiola looks to get one over on his former club. The atmosphere has been building over the last few hours!
3,6.55pm,"Right, without further ado, let me bring you up-to-speed with the all-important team news from the Etihad. Both sides will enter this match off the back of league wins on Saturday – Man City beating West Bromwich Albion 4-0 and Barcelona winning 1-0 at home to Granada. Let's run through the two XIs...© SilverHub"
4,6.58pm,"TEAMS!CITY: Caballero; Zabaleta, Stones, Otamendi, Kolarov; Gundogan, Fernandinho; Silva, De Bruyne, Sterling; AgueroFCB: Ter Stegen; Roberto, Mascherano, Umtiti, Digne; Busquets, Rakitic, Gomes; Neymar, Suarez, Messi"
5,7.02pm,"Man City boss Guardiola has made three changes to the team that recorded a 4-0 win at West Brom on Saturday, with Willy Caballero, Pablo Zabaleta and Kevin de Bruyne taking the places of the suspended Claudio Bravo, Fernando and Nolito. Sergio Aguero was left on the bench for the reverse match against Barcelona, but the Argentine starts tonight in what looks to be a 4-2-3-1 formation. Club captain Vincent Kompany is once again named on the bench as John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi start at centre-back."
6,7.05pm,"Barcelona, meanwhile, are still without the services of key injured trio Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and Andres Iniesta, who would have started in Luis Enrique's strongest team. Lucas Digne and Sergi Roberto keep their spots at full-back, while Samuel Umtiti is selected alongside Javier Mascherano at the heart of the defence. The only contentious call has come in midfield as Andre Gomes is preferred to the likes of Rafinha and Denis Suarez. Up top, Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar all start for the Catalan giants.© SilverHub"
7,7.08pm,"So there we have it. The two teams are in and we are now just about 40 minutes from kickoff on this mild evening in Manchester. I shall talk about Spanish champions Barcelona a little bit later, but let's start with Man City, who bounced back from a six-game winless run with a thumping 4-0 victory over West Brom at the weekend to ensure that they remained top of the Premier League table."
8,7.12pm,"Guardiola's side actually won their first 10 competitive matches of the 2016-17 campaign, but after drawing 3-3 at Celtic in the Champions League on September 28, they had a bit of a wobble. Their first defeat of the season occurred away at Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on October 2 and they failed to win any of the next four – including the 4-0 defeat to Barcelona at Camp Nou.© SilverHub"
9,7.15pm,"Man City were also knocked out of the League Cup last Wednesday after losing 1-0 at Manchester United, but as mentioned, they thumped West Brom 4-0 at the weekend to keep their spot at the top of the Premier League table. Tonight will be a good indicator of where this Man City team need to improve, especially considering Barcelona's four-goal victory in the reverse game last month."
10,7.18pm,"It is worth remembering that Man City actually reached the semi-finals of the Champions League last season before losing to Real Madrid. Indeed, that represented their best ever Champions League campaign and despite dropping points in two of their three group matches this season, Guardiola's team currently sit second in Group C ahead of German side Borussia Monchengladbach."
11,7.22pm,"Man City are also unbeaten in seven home matches in European competition and have not conceded a single goal against continental visitors since last December. Last season, they faced two Spanish clubs at home – beating Sevilla 2-1 in the group stage and drawing 0-0 with Real Madrid in the first leg of their semi-final. I am absolutely certain that Guardiola would take a point tonight.© SilverHub"
12,7.25pm,"In terms of what is ahead for Man City, the Citizens will welcome Middlesbrough to the Etihad in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon, before travelling to out-of-form Crystal Palace after the international break on November 19. Then comes their fourth Champions League group game away to German side Monchengladbach, before ending the month with a trip to Burnley in the league."
13,7.28pm,"As for Barcelona, the Spanish champions moved into second position in La Liga at the weekend courtesy of a 1-0 win over Granada. It was actually a very underwhelming performance from Enrique's side against the division's bottom club, but a super overhead kick from Brazilian midfielder Rafinha secured all the points as they closed the gap on league leaders Real Madrid to just two points."
14,7.32pm,"Barcelona are actually one of only three teams in this season's Champions League with a 100% record after three group matches. The Catalan side thumped Scottish champions Celtic 7-0 at Camp Nou on September 13, before winning 2-1 away at Gladbach on September 28 to make it two wins from two matches. Six points then became nine after the 4-0 victory over Man City two weeks ago.© SilverHub"
15,7.35pm,"Barcelona visited England in the Champions League last season – winning 2-0 at Arsenal in the round of 16. They have actually lost 14 of their 31 European games away to Premier League opposition, however, recording nine wins in the process. In truth, whatever happens tonight, Barcelona should absolutely breeze into the knockout round of the competition once again."
16,7.38pm,"Incredibly, Barcelona have won the Champions League in four of the last 11 seasons. No other team has won it more times in the same period, although Real Madrid have lifted the title in two of the last three campaigns. What's more, Barcelona have reached at least the semi-finals of this competition in seven of the last nine seasons, which is a stunning record at this level of football."
17,7.42pm,"In terms of what is ahead for the Spanish champions, they will travel to high-flying Sevilla in La Liga at the weekend, before hosting Malaga after the international break on November 11. Then comes a trip to Celtic in the Champions League, before ending the month with a league game against Real Sociedad and Copa del Rey clash away to Hercules. Right, kickoff is now just around the corner here!© SilverHub"
18,0 min,KICKOFF! Barcelona kick things off on English soil tonight...
19,2 min,"... it has been a bright start from the visitors, with Umtiti already showing his intent as he carries the ball into the Man City half. Suarez has also had a couple of early touches, with the Uruguay international delivering a dangerous cross towards the edge of the box after a release from Messi."
20,3 min,"The home supporters cheer as Aguero breaks through on the Barcelona goal, but the Argentine had just moved into an offside position. Man City will get chances tonight, I am certain of that."
21,5 min,"Barcelona are the team on the front foot in these early moments, but Man City are leaving Aguero and Silva high up the field, which is a signal of their intent. Barcelona continue to dominate the possession but have not yet found that killer pass. It is a game of cat and mouse at the moment."
22,7 min,"Man City look to play from the back and Caballero over-hits the pass to Otamendi, which brings discontent from the home supporters. Man City manage to break moments later, however, and Digne drags Sterling to the ground. Very fortunate to escape picking up a yellow card there!"
23,9 min,"We are still waiting for the first chance of this match, nine minutes in, but both teams have shown a willingness to commit players in the final third of the field. Barcelona are fortunate to escape another potential booking and again it is Digne that hauls Sterling to the deck. Foul number two."
24,11 min,BOOKING! Sterling (Man City) is booked for Man City after seemingly diving inside the Barcelona box under a challenge from Umtiti. It was very clumsy from the centre-back there!
25,13 min,"Man City are having some joy down the Barcelona left at the moment, with Digne leaving all sorts of space for Sterling to exploit. The home supporters will be encouraged by their team's start here."
26,16 min,"Possession football from the away side in the last couple of minutes as they just look to take the sting out of Man City's forward work. We have not seen too much from the likes of Messi, Suarez and Neymar, however, which is credit to Man City. Still goalless with 16 minutes on the clock here."
27,18 min,"Sterling looks to thread a low cross into Aguero as the home side break once again, but Ter Stegen is on hand to claim. Man City really need to make use of their strong spell in this match."
28,20 min,"Roberto is in all sorts of space down the right as Barcelona thread their way into a forward position, but Suarez cannot find the full-back and Man City regain control of the ball. Just the one booking in this match, but I suspect that tally will grow as late and clumsy challenges continue to occur here."
29,20 min,BOOKING! Rakitic (Barcelona) is booked for a poor challenge on Gundogan.
30,21 min,GOAL! Man City 0-1 Barcelona (Messi)
31,22 min,Oh my word what a goal! Barcelona make the breakthrough as Neymar races clear down the left before sliding a fine pass into Messi and the Argentine settles before finding the bottom corner!
32,24 min,"Man City continue to drive forward and Gundogan decides to hit one from outside the box, but Ter Stegen is on hand to make the save. The home side are flying into Barcelona at the moment, but the Spanish outfit are leaving Neymar, Suarez and Messi up the pitch, which spells danger."
33,26 min,"Messi looks to slide a pass into Gomes as Barcelona drive forward once again, but Caballero is on hand to claim and release Sterling in a wide position. It is a super game of football at the Etihad."
34,28 min,"Messi, for once, picks the wrong pass as the Argentine looks for Suarez inside the Man City box and it bounces behind for a goal-kick. Man City really need to be careful here as they continue to leave four against three in a defensive area. Aguero, however, remains really dangerous for the home side."
35,29 min,CLOSE! Neymar hits the side-netting as Barcelona continue to threaten here.
36,29 min,BOOKING! Neymar (Barcelona) is booked for bringing Sterling to the deck.
37,32 min,"The home supporters are doing their best to raise their team, but Barcelona are just passing around them at the moment as they look to work space in the final third. A second for the away side at this stage would make things very, very difficult for Man City, who continue to commit players forward."
38,34 min,"Man City have been pretty good in this first period, but they have not really tested Ter Stegen, who has been comfortable between the sticks. The high press is working when it comes to shutting down Barcelona's defence, but Neymar, Suarez and Messi seem to have an awful lot of space here."
39,36 min,"CHANCE! Wonderful chance for Barcelona as Messi clips a cross back to Suarez after Gomes had a close-range strike blocked, but Suarez can only angle his header wide of the post!"
40,38 min,Barcelona are dominant at the moment as they continue to work space in the final third. A second goal at this stage would be really hurtful to Man City's chances of securing a positive result tonight.
41,39 min,GOAL! Man City 1-1 Barcelona (Gundogan)
42,40 min,"Man City hit back in the 39th minute of this match as Barcelona mess around on the edge of their own box and Aguero slides in Sterling, whose low cross is smashed home by Gundogan. Barcelona took a chance at the back and the home side made use of it to level the scores at the Etihad!"
43,42 min,"CHANCE! Another chance for the home side as the high press works once again and Fernandinho looks to find the bottom corner, but his effort is just wide of the post. This game has turned!"
44,44 min,"Messi goes down inside the Man City box and looks at the referee, but the contact from Fernandinho was on the ball and the referee says no thank you. Brilliant game at the moment."
45,45 min+1,"Barcelona could have scored a second during a strong spell after their opening goal, but Man City are now the team driving forward and Barcelona do not look comfortable with the high press. The away side want the first period to end, but the home supporters are full of noise now!"
46,45 min+1,HALF-TIME: Man City 1-1 Barcelona
47,8.31pm,"So there we have it. The referee brings the first period to a close with the two teams level at 1-1. Messi sent Barcelona ahead in the 21st minute with a cool finish, but Man City levelled six minutes before the break when Gundogan converted a Sterling cross after a mistake from Barcelona. It has been a wonderful game of football from the Etihad. More of the same in the second period please!"
48,8.36pm,"STATISTICS! Barcelona have shaded the possession with 59%, but the goal attempts and shots on target for both teams are exactly the same - five (two). There have also been three yellow cards, with Sterling in the book for the home side, and Rakitic and Neymar booked for the visitors. Barcelona, meanwhile, have completed 260 passes to Man City's 132. Brilliant action so far at the Etihad."
49,8.41pm,"BENCH WATCH! Man City are not exactly flush with attacking options on their bench tonight, but Iheanacho, Navas and Nolito are all available for Guardiola. Barcelona, meanwhile, have the likes of Rafinha, Alcacer, Turan and Denis Suarez in reserve. Will there be any changes at the interval? Unlikely."
50,46 min,RESTART! Man City resume the action on home soil...
51,47 min,"... no changes from either side at the break, which is not a surprise at this stage of events. You just get the feeling that the next goal - if there indeed is one - could be vital in terms of the final result."
52,48 min,"CHANCE! Stunning chance for the home side as another piece of poor Barcelona defending presents Man City with the ball, but Sterling just goes too wide and can only hit the side-netting after facing up to Ter Stegen. Moments later, Aguero fires a long-range effort wide of the post."
53,50 min,"Neymar takes a bit of time to return to his feet after a heavy challenge from Otamendi, which brought Barcelona a free kick. The set piece is poor though and the hosts can break once again."
54,50 min,Man City now have a dangerous free kick as Busquets brings Silva to the deck...
55,51 min,... GOAL! Man City 2-1 Barcelona (De Bruyne)
56,52 min,"Man City take the lead at the Etihad as De Bruyne's free kick finds the back of the net. It was a powerful strike, but I am not sure what Ter Stegen is doing there. He really has to save it!"
57,54 min,"CHANCE! Another wonderful chance for the home side as a brilliant set piece from De Bruyne finds Otamendi at the far post, but the centre-back just cannot make contact. Wow!"
58,56 min,"Barcelona have just managed to get hold of the ball in the last couple of minutes, which is absolutely vital at this stage of the match. Man City have already taken the lead and could have had a couple more considering the opportunities. Barcelona have to find a different gear at the Etihad."
59,57 min,"Messi stands a cross towards the back post, where Neymar is hovering, but it is too strong and Man City can resume play from the dead-ball line. Still plenty of football left to play at the Etihad tonight."
60,58 min,CHANCE! Aguero meets a super free kick from Silva and his header just drops wide of the post. Barcelona are just not sure at the back as they continue to struggle here.
61,60 min,BOOKING! Kolarov (Man City) is booked for blocking Rakitic's run.
62,60 min,MAN CITY SUB! Man City are forced into a change as Fernando replaces Fernandinho.
63,62 min,"Suarez manages to turn inside the Man City box and the striker looks to release, but blue shirts surround him and the ball eventually bounces back to Caballero. We are entering a vital stage of this match and Barcelona are preparing to make their first change as Turan readies himself!"
64,62 min,BARCELONA SUB! Turan replaces Rakitic for the away side.
65,63 min,"CHANCE! Another chance for the home side as Kolarov slides a wonderful cross into an area where De Bruyne and Aguero are waiting, but both players miss the ball. Some chance that!"
66,65 min,"CROSSBAR! Oh my word! Stones sends Suarez away with a poor pass and the striker settles before feeding Gomes in space, but the midfielder smashes the ball against the crossbar!"
67,66 min,De Bruyne just misses the post with a low strike after a quick counter-attack from the hosts!
68,68 min,"Barcelona keep conceding possession in dangerous areas and Man City have another chance as Silva dances into the box, but the Spaniard is just forced wide and can only hit the side-netting. Moments later, Sterling breaks through on goal only to see the offside flag raised. What a game!"
69,70 min,"Still more than 20 minutes of this football match remaining and I would be very surprised if we had seen the last of the goals at the Etihad. Man City continue to cause problems, but Barcelona are always going to be dangerous in the final third. They just sent a warning with that Gomes strike."
70,71 min,MAN CITY SUB! Jesus Navas replaces Sterling for the home side.
71,74 min,"Roberto and Busquets combine to clear their lines as a deep cross from Zabaleta causes problems inside the Barcelona box. It is quite incredible how many times the away side have been robbed of possession, especially in the second period. Still 2-1 Man City with 74 minutes on the clock here."
72,74 min,GOAL! Man City 3-1 Barcelona (Gundogan)
73,75 min,Man City score their third of the night in the 74th minute as Gundogan fires home from close range after a cross from Navas had hit Aguero and bounced kindly for the German midfielder!
74,77 min,BARCELONA SUB! Rafinha replaces Gomes for Barcelona.
75,79 min,"You just get the feeling that there are more goals in this match and if Barcelona can score a second in the next five minutes or so, it would set up a pulsating conclusion to this game at the Etihad."
76,81 min,Barcelona have a free kick in a dangerous area as Otamendi fells Suarez...
77,82 min,... Messi strikes straight into the wall as his struggles in the second period continue.
78,84 min,"Man City again launch a counter-attack when Barcelona lose possession and Roberto needs to deal with a deep cross from De Bruyne, who has been brilliant in the second half of this match."
79,86 min,"Barcelona continue to pass and probe in the final third of the field, but they just cannot get Neymar and Messi in the match, while Suarez remains isolated at the tip of the front three."
80,88 min,"Frustration for Suarez as the Barcelona forward is flagged offside, which brings cheers from the home supporters. Man City are closing on a big three points after a big performance here."
81,89 min,MAN CITY SUB! Nolito replaces De Bruyne for the home side.
82,90 min+1,We are into the first of three additional minutes here.
83,90 min+1,"Messi reacts first to a deep Neymar free kick, but his header is weak and Caballero can claim. The home supporters are in good voice as we approach the referee's full-time whistle at the Etihad."
84,90 min+3,Little bit of keep-ball for Man City as the clock ticks on.
85,90 min+4,FULL-TIME: Man City 3-1 Barcelona
86,9.36pm,"So there we have it. Special night for Man City as they run out 3-1 winners over Barcelona, who really struggled in the second period. That is just about it from me tonight, but be sure to stick around for all of tonight's Champions League action. Join us again soon for more live coverage!"
