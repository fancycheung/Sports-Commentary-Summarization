0,8.01pm,"Evening all! Sports Mole's live Copa del Rey coverage continues from Camp Nou as holders Barcelona welcome Segunda B side Hercules for the second leg of their last-32 clash. It is a big ask for Hercules tonight, but the tie is level at 1-1 following the first leg last month. What's more, Hercules incredibly recorded a 2-0 victory in this stadium during the 2010-11 La Liga season and therefore have previous in terms of winning here! Be sure to stay tuned for what should be a fascinating night of football."
1,8.04pm,"It was experienced Paraguay forward Nelson Valdez that struck twice for Hercules during their 2-0 victory away to Barcelona in September 2010 to help the Alicante-based team pull off one of the biggest shocks in Spain's top flight. Times have changed since then, however, with Hercules now playing their football in the Segunda B Division and Barcelona still flying high at the top of the Spanish game."
2,8.07pm,"Second-leg matches involving the big teams at this stage of the competition are usually dead rubbers, but that is simply not the case tonight. This last-32 clash is currently level at 1-1 following the first leg in Alicante on November 30. Hercules actually took the lead on the night through David Mainz, before Carles Alena's first goal for the Barcelona first team levelled the scores."
3,8.10pm,"Right, without further ado, let me bring you up-to-speed with the all-important team news from Camp Nou. Has Luis Enrique rested a number of his big players once again, or is the Spaniard taking no chances tonight? Let's run through the two XIs that will start this Copa del Rey contest..."
4,8.13pm,"TEAMS!BARCA: Cillessen; Vidal, Umtiti, Mascherano, Digne; Denis, Rakitic, Gomes; Rafinha, Alcacer, TuranHERCULES: Buigues; Dalmau, Pena, Roman, Bueso; Rojas, Chechu, Checa; Berrocal, Minano, Gaspar"
5,8.16pm,"Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has made nine changes to the team that started the 4-1 win over Espanyol at the weekend, with Javier Mascherano and Denis Suarez the only two players to keep their spots. Jasper Cillessen replaces Marc-Andre ter Stegen between the sticks, while Aleix Vidal, Lucas Digne and Paco Alcacer are among those that come into the XI. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar will play no part tonight, but Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta are both on the bench.© SilverHub"
6,8.19pm,"As for Hercules, David Mainz, who scored in the first leg, is only on the bench. Jose Luis Minano, Jesus Berrocal and Jose Gaspar will make up the away side's front three, while experienced midfielder Chechu starts in the middle of the park. Paco Pena will skipper the team from central defence, but there is no place in the squad for Cameroon midfielder Franck Omgba."
7,8.22pm,"So there we have it. The two teams are in and we are now just about 40 minutes from kickoff on this mild evening in Barcelona. I shall speak about the away side a little bit later, but let's start with Barcelona, who have their eye on a 29th Copa del Rey crown this season. They are also the holders of this competition after recording a 2-0 victory over Sevilla in the 2016 final. In fact, the Catalan giants have been present in each of the last three Copa finals and will have their eyes on a fourth."
8,8.25pm,"With La Liga leaders Real Madrid taking part in the Club World Cup, Sunday's 4-1 win over Espanyol allowed Barcelona to move to within three points of Los Blancos at the top of the table. The title race is still very much in the hands of Zinedine Zidane's side, but Barcelona have bounced back from a little stumble to win their last three games in all competitions.© SilverHub"
9,8.28pm,"After drawing 1-1 with Real Madrid at Camp Nou on December 3, Barcelona beat Borussia Monchengladbach 4-0 in their final Champions League group match, before putting three answered goals past Osasuna in the league. Arguably their finest performance of the season came at home to Espanyol on Sunday as Lionel Messi absolutely dazzled in a 4-1 success."
10,8.32pm,"It would be fair to say that the Copa del Rey is behind La Liga and the Champions League in terms of priorities for the Catalan giants this season, but with Real Madrid absolutely flying, this competition might well be Barcelona's best chance of a trophy this season. It is not the worst thing in the world to fall back on if success in the league and Europe does not arrive once again."
11,8.35pm,"After tonight's match, Barcelona will have 18 days off as the players recharge their batteries for the second half of the campaign. Their next league match is away to a brilliant Villarreal team on January 8 and Enrique's team will be hoping that Real Madrid have a stumble following their Club World Cup exertions, which is exactly what happened to Barcelona last season.© SilverHub"
12,8.38pm,"As for Hercules, this is actually their best run in the Copa del Rey since the 2010-11 season, which was the last time that they competed in the top flight of Spanish football. They dropped to the Segunda in 2011 and have since fallen to the third tier after another relegation in the 2013-14 season."
13,8.42pm,"Hercules have finished fourth and third respectively in each of their last two Segunda B seasons, but are currently well placed to challenge for promotion this term – sitting fourth in the table on 33 points. They are just four points behind second-place Alcoyano and just six points off Barcelona II. In truth, progressing past this stage of the Copa del Rey will be very tough and their focus has to be on gaining promotion to the second tier once again. Kickoff at Camp Nou is now under 20 minutes away!"
14,8.45pm,"While it is a very difficult task for the visitors, they have won each of their last three in the league without conceding since the first leg with Barcelona. Goals have been a bit of a problem – scoring just 27 times in 19 league matches – but they have only conceded 15 times, which is the second-best defensive record in the division. It would be some achievement if they could pull off a result tonight."
15,8.48pm,"Calentando en el Camp Nou. A media hora de comenzar el partido #MachoHércules pic.twitter.com/bpSVNGhLhV— Hércules CF Oficial (@cfhercules) December 21, 2016 "
16,8.52pm,"Just a reminder of the two teams for tonight's match...BARCA: Cillessen; Vidal, Umtiti, Mascherano, Digne; Denis, Rakitic, Gomes; Rafinha, Alcacer, TuranHERCULES: Buigues; Dalmau, Pena, Roman, Bueso; Rojas, Chechu, Checa; Berrocal, Minano, Gaspar"
17,8.55pm,"Here we go then - both sets of players join us on the pitch for the first period. Barcelona struggled to a 1-1 draw with Hercules in the first leg, but Enrique has sent out a very experienced XI tonight. It would be a major shock if they did not get the job done, but Hercules have previous in this ground!"
18,0 min,KICKOFF! Barcelona kick things off at Camp Nou...
19,2 min,"... far from a full house inside Camp Nou tonight, but there is still a good atmosphere and those in attendance will be looking for a strong Barcelona performance. Vidal breaks down the right immediately for the home side and delivers low towards Alcacer, but Buigues is on hand to collect."
20,4 min,"As expected, the home side have been in control of the early possession as they look to take control of this tie. Hercules are just about surviving as they shuffle across the pitch, but it could be a long night if that pattern of play continues. There is a sea of white shirts in front of Barcelona."
21,5 min,"Digne breaks forward for Barcelona and decides to have a pop from a wide angle, but his effort is over the crossbar. Hercules have not managed to enjoy any possession early on here."
22,7 min,"The pressure continues as Digne again breaks down the left and delivers into Alcacer, but Roman just does enough to make the clearance. It is simply all Barcelona in the early moments tonight."
23,9 min,"Still no shot on target with nine minutes on the clock, but it does seem a matter of time as Barcelona continue to dominate the ball. Mascherano comes forward for a set piece and makes contact in a central position, but the ball trickles wide of the post. Too easy for the hosts here."
24,11 min,"There have been some tasty challenges in the early stages of this match and Hercules midfielder Rojas is fortunate to escape a booking after bringing Rafinha to the deck. Checa then absolutely cleans out Turan, but still no booking. Free kick for Barcelona in a decent position here..."
25,11 min,... disappointing delivery as Roman stoops low to clear the ball.
26,14 min,"Pass, pass, pass from Barcelona as they look to work that yard of space, but Hercules are proving a tough nut to crack as they shuffle across the pitch as one unit. Umtiti and Mascherano have both stepped into midfield in the last few minutes, while Alba and Vidal are both very advanced."
27,16 min,"Berrocal is leading the line for Hercules tonight, but the number nine has not been involved in the game in the opening 16 minutes. Again Barcelona look long as Rakitic spots the run of Vidal, but goalkeeper Buigues is on hand to claim. Still 1-1 in this Copa del Rey last-32 contest."
28,18 min,"Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid both had very easy passages into the last-16 stage of this competition, but Barcelona are finding Hercules tough to break down. The Segunda B side were arguably the better team in the first leg and they have been comfortable inside 18 minutes tonight."
29,20 min,"CHANCE! Super chance for the home side as Turan breaks into the Hercules box before delivering a low cross into Denis Suarez, but Bueso is on hand to make an outstanding block!"
30,22 min,"Hercules goalkeeper Buigues has had to be alert to claim a number of high balls in the opening 22 minutes of this match, but the Spaniard has not been overly worked, which is a surprise at this stage of the contest. The visitors have been very impressive with their shape and defensive work."
31,24 min,"Pass, pass, pass from Barcelona. Defend, defend, defend from Hercules. It is not a low-key affair, however, with both teams putting in some serious work. It is a fascinating tactical battle."
32,26 min,"Umtiti is the only Barcelona player inside his own half at the moment as the home side continue to press. Eventually Rakitic has a pop from distance, but his effort was always rising over the crossbar."
33,27 min,Checa looks in a spot of bother for the visitors after taking a late challenge from Denis Suarez.
34,28 min,Checa is back on his feet and it does appear that the central midfielder will continue. It is not every week that Hercules play at Camp Nou so I suspect that he will be fit to resume the action.
35,28 min,"CHANCE! Chechu's pace takes him clear of the Barcelona defence and he breaks into the box to face Cillessen, but Mascherano comes from nowhere to make a stunning tackle!"
36,31 min,"I am confident that Barcelona will win tonight, but I really fancy the away side to find the back of the net. Chechu is causing problems with his pace and movement, while Barcelona are so forward-thinking that there is space available on the counter-attack. It is a really fascinating game here."
37,32 min,"SAVE! Denis Suarez twists and turns inside the Hercules box before deciding to have a pop, but his effort is wide of the near post. Great feet, but the midfielder might have passed there!"
38,34 min,"Safe hands from Buigues once again as the Hercules goalkeeper rises to collect a cross from Rakitic, which looked to be finding Digne. Hercules then break down the other end with Chechu, who delivers a dangerous cross towards Berrocal, but Umtiti makes the defensive clearance."
39,36 min,"Digne continues to break forward for Barcelona, but the service into the left-back has not been of the required standard, while the same can be said for Vidal down the opposite side of the field."
40,37 min,"Little over five minutes of the first period remaining and we are still goalless on the night and 1-1 on aggregate in this Copa del Rey last-32 contest. Hercules have actually had a period of decent possession in the last couple of minutes, although Cillessen remained unharmed between the sticks."
41,37 min,GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Hercules (Digne)
42,38 min,Barcelona make the breakthrough in the 37th minute as Rafinha's strike is blocked into the path of Digne and the left-back takes a touch before poking the ball past the Hercules goalkeeper!
43,41 min,"The opening goal is tough on Hercules, but they have been under a lot of pressure and you felt that Barcelona would make the breakthrough at some point. It is so important that the visitors do not concede a second at this stage of the match, especially this close to the half-time interval."
44,43 min,"Some untidy scenes as Vidal clashes with a couple of Hercules defenders, but the referee is on hand to calm proceedings and no bookings are produced, which is always good to see."
45,43 min,BOOKING! Pena (Hercules). Scrap that! Pena was booked for clashing with Vidal.
46,43 min,BOOKING! Vidal (Barcelona) is booked in the same incident.
47,45 min,"Another half-chance for the home side and Digne appears to be in the mood tonight as he meets a cross from the right, but the left-back's effort is wide of the post. Hercules have to settle down."
48,45 min,PENALTY BARCELONA!
49,45 min,Barcelona have a penalty as Roman brings Turan to the ground with a clumsy challenge!
50,45 min,"GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Hercules (Rakitic, pen)"
51,45 min+1,Rakitic finds a route under Buigues as Barcelona take a 2-0 lead on home soil.
52,45 min+2,HALF-TIME: Barcelona 2-0 Hercules (Barcelona lead 3-1 on aggregate)
53,9.47pm,"So there we have it. The referee brings the first period to a close with Barcelona leading 2-0 on the night and 3-1 on aggregate courtesy of goals from Digne and Rakitic. Hercules were impressive for long spells of the first 45 minutes, but they now have a serious mountain to climb in this clash."
54,9.52pm,"STATISTICS! Barcelona have dominated the possession with 77%, while they have managed eight attempts, although just two of those - the two goals - were on target. Hercules, meanwhile, have not yet managed a single shot, but they have created a number of dangerous situations at Camp Nou."
55,9.57pm,"BENCH WATCH! Alba, Busquets, Iniesta and Roberto are the four outfield players on the Barcelona bench tonight, while Hercules have options in the shape of Juanma, Mainz, Nieto and Salinas. Luis Enrique took no chances tonight - naming a very strong bench in addition to an experienced XI."
56,10.03pm,"🚩 At the break Barça lead 2-0 thanks to goals from Digne and Rakitic (pen.) #FCBLive #CopaFCB pic.twitter.com/wmMLMS9wJT— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) December 21, 2016 "
57,46 min,RESTART! Hercules resume the action here...
58,47 min,... HERCULES SUB! Nieto has replaced Gaspar for the away side.
59,49 min,"It will be interesting to see whether Barcelona really go for Hercules in this second period, or whether they take a more relaxed approach to the second period. While the visitors have nothing to lose, they will not want to take a pasting tonight by committing a lot of numbers forward."
60,50 min,GOAL! Barcelona 3-0 Hercules (Rafinha)
61,51 min,Barcelona have their third of the night as Rafinha fires home from the edge of the box. It is a brilliant strike from the Brazilian and that should be that in terms of this last-32 clash.
62,55 min,GOAL! Barcelona 4-0 Hercules (Turan)
63,56 min,Barcelona have their fourth of the night as Vidal delivers a dangerous cross towards Turan and the Turkish international is on hand to head home from close range. Hercules are really struggling now!
64,58 min,"Little over 30 minutes of this Copa del Rey clash remaining and Hercules are really struggling at the moment as Barcelona, who have had 70% of the ball, continue to pass and probe."
65,61 min,"No movement on the Barcelona bench as things stand, but we cannot be too far away from a change. Alcacer scored in a friendly for the Catalan giants last week, but he has still not scored a competitive goal for his new club and the striker will be desperate to find the net tonight."
66,63 min,"CHANCE! Speaking of Alcacer! The striker has just had a super chance after Denis Suarez delivered a dangerous cross into the Hercules box, but Alcacer could not make contact!"
67,65 min,"Chechu delivers a free kick into the Barcelona box, but Mascherano is on hand to make the clearance as Hercules waste a good opportunity. The visitors will want a goal for their troubles here."
68,67 min,"Turan rises at the far post to meet a cross from Rafinha, but the attacker's header never had enough power to trouble the Hercules goalkeeper. Still 4-0 on the night and 5-1 on aggregate."
69,70 min,HERCULES SUB! Salinas replaces Berrocal for the away side.
70,72 min,"Not too much to report in terms of chances in the last few minutes, but Barcelona continue to dominate possession. Still no movement on the home side's bench with 72 minutes on the clock."
71,73 min,GOAL! Barcelona 5-0 Hercules (Alcacer)
72,74 min,Finally for Alcacer! The Spaniard finally opens his account for Barcelona as the striker heads home from close range after Rafinha had delivered into a dangerous position. He is delighted!
73,76 min,Little under 15 minutes of the second period remaining and Barcelona lead 5-0 on the night and 6-1 on aggregate. It has been tough for Hercules since the second goal went in before the break.
74,78 min,"CHANCE! Wonderful chance for Hercules to register as Rojas rises highest inside the Barcelona goal, but his header is just wide of the post. So close to a consolation!"
75,80 min,Denis Suarez is denied by a super challenge from Roman after dancing into the Hercules box once again. Still a solid 10 minutes of football to play in this match and I fancy at least one more goal.
76,83 min,"Rakitic hits one from distance, but Buigues is down to make the save. Hercules just want this one to be over as the pressure continues from the home side, who have had too much in the second period. They are heading into the next round alongside the likes of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid."
77,85 min,Little over five minutes of the second period remaining and Barcelona are still looking for more goals as they pass and probe in the final third. It has been a very tough second period for Hercules.
78,86 min,GOAL! Barcelona 6-0 Hercules (Turan)
79,87 min,Barcelona have their sixth of the night in the 86th minute as Turan hammers home from close range after Buigues had kept out a close-range Alcacer header with a brilliant save!
80,89 min,SAVE! Buigues makes a super stop to keep out Alcacer's low strike!
81,89 min,GOAL! Barcelona 7-0 Hercules (Turan)
82,90 min,Turan has his hat-trick as the Turkish international curls a stunning effort into the top corner after working some space in a wide position. It is a stunning finish from the hat-trick hero.
83,90 min+1,FULL-TIME: Barcelona 7-0 Hercules (Barcelona win 8-1 on aggregate)
84,10.51pm,So there we have it. The referee brings the second period to a close with Barcelona running out 7-0 winners on the night and 8-1 on aggregate to book their spot in the last-16 stage of the Copa del Rey. Thanks for joining Sports Mole for the live action once again. Until next time!
