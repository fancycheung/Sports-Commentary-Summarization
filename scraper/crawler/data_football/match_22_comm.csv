0,12.30pm,"Hello and welcome to Sports Mole's live text coverage of the FA Cup third-round tie between Liverpool and Plymouth Argyle at Anfield. This is a rare meeting between these two teams, currently separated by three divisions, in what has the potential to provide us with our first major giant killing of the third round. The likes of Manchester United and Manchester City have already progressed through - now it is the turn of one of the competition's most successful sides."
1,12.32pm,"There is no denying that the Premier League takes priority for Jurgen Klopp this season, which will likely be reflected when we check out the team news in a couple of minutes, but the German did talk this week about building up some momentum and putting together a cup run. It is a similar story for visitors Plymouth, who are good value to return to League One come May after a six-year absence from the third tier of English football."
2,12.34pm,"TEAM NEWS!LIVERPOOL XI: Karius; Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Lucas, Moreno; Stewart, Can; Ejaria, Ojo, Woodburn; OrigiPLYMOUTH ARGYLE XI: McCormick; Miller, Songo'o, Bradley, Purrington; Threlkeld, Fox; Jervis, Carey, Slew; Garita"
3,12.36pm,"As expected, Klopp has made mass changes to his starting lineup for this third-round tie. Ten alterations in all from the 2-2 draw with Sunderland last time out, in fact, with Emre Can the only player to retain his place in the side. The big news is that Joe Gomez is handed his first appearance of any sort for 16 months after battling back from injury - his first outing under the watch of Klopp, which puts his length of time on the sidelines into some perspective."
4,12.38pm,"There is also a full senior debut for Wales international prospect Ben Woodburn; a player now best remembered for his memorable goal against Leeds United in the EFL Cup last month to make him the Reds' youngest-ever goalscorer. Woodburn will start in attack alongside Sheyi Ojo and Divock Origi - the latter providing the closest thing this Liverpool attack has to experience, despite being just 21 years of age himself."
5,12.40pm,"Lucas Leiva was reportedly close to making a switch to Serie A earlier this month, but he is still involved at Anfield and takes his place in the heart of defence this afternoon. Alongside the experienced Brazilian is the versatile Gomez, while Alberto Moreno Trent Alexander-Arnold occupy the two full-back berths. The other academy player in the starting ranks is Ovie Ejaria, who will take up his position in midfield in what can best be described as an experimental Reds side."
6,12.42pm,"This is actually the youngest side ever named by Liverpool, but the changes have been less forthcoming as far as the visitors are concerned. The big question mark heading into the match regarded the fitness of Paul-Arnold Garita, who has appeared to shake off his recent knee complaint to take his place in the starting ranks this afternoon. Nouris Bulvitis had been carrying a knock of his own, but he misses out on selection at Anfield."
7,12.44pm,"One other point of discussion when looking at that Liverpool team, Loris Karius is given a chance to impress this afternoon - as Klopp confirmed a few days back - just a few weeks after losing his starting spot to Simon Mignolet. That position really does need strengthening this month, but for now the two mistake-prone keepers are left to battle it out between the sticks. No Philippe Coutinho still, while Jordan Henderson - with three assists in five FA Cup outings - also misses out."
8,12.46pm,"BENCH WATCH!LIVERPOOL SUBS: Mignolet, Klavan, Clyne, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Firmino, SturridgePLYMOUTH ARGYLE SUBS: Bulvitis, Smith, Goodwillie, Osborne, Rooney, Dorel, Tanner"
9,12.48pm,"The starting lineup may lack experienced heads, but it is fair to say that Klopp has plenty of ammunition on the bench should he need to change things around slightly. Adam Lallana, Roberto Firmino and Daniel Sturridge are all among the back-up options available for the German to choose from, while Georginio Wijnaldum, Nathaniel Clyne and Ragnar Klavan provide depth in those deeper positions."
10,12.50pm,"Liverpool have named their youngest-ever starting lineup for this afternoon's visit of Plymouth Argyle, in a side that includes just one starter from last time out - versatile midfielder Emre Can. Among those to be given the nod are full debutant Ben Woodburn and Joe Gomez - a first appearance of any sort in 18 months for the defender, who has seen his development curtailed since joining from Charlton Athletic.© SilverHub"
11,12.52pm,"A look at Liverpool's team, albeit backed by an incredibly talented bench, highlights just how low down on the list of priorities the FA Cup is for this club. That is not to say Klopp is happy to forget about the competition, particularly after falling short in two finals in his first campaign at the helm, but winning the Premier League is the outright top target over these next four months or so. The Reds also have an EFL Cup semi-final with Southampton in midweek, which is also higher up the list."
12,12.54pm,"The Reds now trail Chelsea by just five points at the summit, despite being held to a draw by strugglers Sunderland earlier this week. Liverpool had recovered from a disappointing start to December, in which they lost to Bournemouth and drew at home to West Ham United, by winning four on the spin in the Premier League prior to that trip to the Stadium of Light six days ago. It is still very much all to play for now, then, with the Blues now having to recover from that loss to Tottenham Hotspur - a first in 14 outings."
13,12.56pm,"It is all systems go for Klopp's charges at this stage in the season, as they follow up this FA Cup tie with the first left of their EFL Cup semi-final against Southampton on Wednesday evening. The side named by the German for that one will be interesting to see, with a crunch clash against an in-form Manchester United to come just a few days later in the Premier League. Liverpool also take on Chelsea at the end of the month; a run of games sandwiched by the visit of Swansea City."
14,12.58pm,"Despite their wobble in the North East last Monday, the Reds - as highlighted by Klopp in his pre-match press conference - are still well on track to achieving their goals. Second in the Premier League and into the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, it has been an impressive first full campaign on Merseyside for the Reds' popular boss. Just two defeats in 24 games overall is quite some record; the most recent of those losses coming in a crazy 4-3 encounter against Bournemouth on December 4."
15,1.00pm,"DID YOU KNOW? Liverpool have never lost an FA Cup game against a team from the fourth tier, winning 12 and drawing three, while also progressing into round four in each of their last five attempts. Not since 2010-11 have they failed to get past the first hurdle, when knocked out by great rivals Manchester United at this early stage. You will get some good odds on a rare third-round defeat for the Reds this afternoon!"
16,1.02pm,"Liverpool have also gone five years without shipping a single goal at Anfield in the FA Cup. Five clean sheets have been kept during that run, so Plymouth really do have their work cut out to get any sort of result over the next couple of hours. The Reds' backline is not the greatest on paper today, though, and if the Pilgrims can bring their recent league form into this game - minus their defeat to Barnet last time out - then they have a chance of pulling off an upset."
17,1.04pm,"Plymouth have also enjoyed a bright first half to their league campaign, currently occupying one of the three automatic promotion berths in League Two and looking likely to now end their six-year exile from the third tier. The Pilgrims' league form has been mixed since the middle of November, losing four and winning three of their last eight games, yet they still sit six points clear of fourth-placed Portsmouth with four months of the season left to play."
18,1.06pm,"Their tag of being so-called 'bottlers' may be playing on the mind as the final stretch of the season slowly comes into sight, and three defeats on the spin a little over a month ago certainly will not have helped matters. There was also that loss to Barnet last Monday - hardly ideal preparation for what is one of the biggest days out in years for those hardy Pilgrims, who will as ever travel in numbers this afternoon to pack out that away end at Anfield, despite the mammoth trek."
19,1.08pm,"Argyle have home games with Stevenage and Blackpool to come before the end of the month, as well as a trip to Cheltenham - three winnable fixtures that you would back them to take at least seven points from. In terms of their FA Cup exploits, the Pilgrims saw off Mansfield in round one proper and overcame a tricky Newport County side in the last round - a match that was finally concluded late into extra time of the replay after two goalless 90-minute matches."
20,1.10pm,"Plymouth have been eliminated in each of their last 11 meetings against top-flight opposition in this competition, with their most recent win against a Premier League side coming against West Bromwich Albion in the fifth round of the 1983-84 campaign. A chance to put that right this afternoon, as they take on a Liverpool side showing 10 changes from their most recent outing - a 2-2 draw with Sunderland at the Stadium of Light six days ago.© Getty Images"
21,1.12pm,"PREVIOUS MEETINGS! This game will mark the first time these two sides have met in the FA Cup. They last faced off in a fixture of any king in April 1962 when playing in the second tier of English football - plenty has changed since then, it is fair to say. Plymouth Argyle have never beaten Liverpool at Anfield, in fact, losing three and drawing two between 1954 and 1961 when they met on a more regular basis."
22,1.14pm,"With kickoff at Anfield in this FA Cup third-round tie now around 15 minutes away, let us check out some pre-match thoughts from both camps.Jurgen Klopp: ""What is certain is that our approach to facing Plymouth today will be that this is our most important game of the season. Why? Because it is our next game. This is our attitude and it has to be. The players have shown all season they understand this and believe in the approach.""Derek Adams: ""This will be up there in the top five experiences of my managerial career to be stood on the sidelines at Anfield. It's not quite the very top because that was going 40 games unbeaten in Scotland and being a First Division club in the Scottish Cup Final, beating the likes of Celtic and Hibernian. However, if we beat them then it goes to the top."""
23,1.16pm,"Plymouth boss Adams admitting that this match is right up there as far as his coaching career goes, having also enjoyed a stint in Scottish football. Not quite the very top achievement, he says, but victory at Anfield against the country's second-best side this season will overtake anything that he has previously achieved in the game. Argyle will be backed by a heavy hoard of away fans this afternoon, so the incentive is certainly there."
24,1.18pm,"Klopp describes today's match as his side's ""most important"" of the season, meanwhile, taking the approach of so many managers before him by taking it one game at a time. It is hard to criticise the German for overhauling his side, with those 10 changes from last time out a real mockery for a great competition, though not only do they face Manchester United next weekend but they also have to prepare for an EFL Cup semi-final with Southampton three days from now."
25,1.20pm,"PREDICTION! A first meeting of any sorts between these two sides since April 1962, then, and a first ever in the FA Cup. Liverpool have named their youngest-ever side for the visit of fourth-tier Plymouth Argyle but, even with experienced players few and far between, they should still have enough to get the job done. Even still, should things not go to plan Klopp has the likes of Firmino, Lallana and Sturridge to call upon, so I am going with a 2-0 home win."
26,1.22pm,"This is not the only game taking place in the FA Cup this afternoon, incidentally, as Fulham are just a few minutes away from putting their name in the hat for round four thanks to what looks likely to be a 2-1 win over Cardiff City. Big boys Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur also kick off their campaigns later today with games against Peterborough United and Aston Villa respectively, while Sheffield Wednesday visit the North East to take on Middlesbrough at 3pm."
27,1.24pm,"We have been devoid of too many shocks so far in the third round of the competition, with Millwall's 3-0 win over a weakened Bournemouth very much the pick of Saturday's results. A couple of the minnows suffered defeats, including non-league Eastleigh who shipped five in the first half against Brentford at Griffin Park. A string of Premier League teams did join Bournemouth in dropping out, however, with Liverpool looking to avoid becoming the latest victims."
28,1.26pm,"The two sets of players have now made their way into the tunnel area at Anfield, with kickoff just four minutes or so away now. A handful of teenagers in the Reds' starting lineup for this one, levelling the playing field a little against an up-for-it Plymouth. Worth pointing out that Ryan Sessegnon scored the decisive second goal for Fulham in their win over Cardiff City, making him the competition's youngest-ever scorer."
29,1.28pm,"Plymouth fans certainly enjoying their day out at the moment, belting out chant after chant on what they hope will be a day to remember. Around 9,000 visiting fans made the 10-hour round trip in all, while the home fans have also packed out the ground - including that impressive new Main Stand. A reminder that this is Liverpool's youngest-ever starting lineup, with Ben Woodburn handed his full debut and Joe Gomez a first start since Klopp took charge in 2015.© SilverHub"
30,1 min,"KICKOFF! Liverpool get us under way at Anfield in this FA Cup third-round tie, sporting their traditional home strip. Plymouth Argyle, backed by 9,000 travelling fans this afternoon, will be looking to quickly settle into their groove."
31,3 min,"A decent delivery into the box nearly reaches Origi, but it was cleared behind for a corner in the nick of time. Ejaria, with a couple of starts under his belt already, blasts wide from the edge of the box when the set piece is half-cleared."
32,5 min,"A ball from deep is so nearly latched on to by Ojo, but it had just a little too much on it and McCormick was able to collect. Argyle maybe sitting a little too deep at the moment, showing the Reds too much respect in the middle of the park."
33,7 min,"Alexander-Arnold delivers another promising cross into the box, which the visitors are able to deal with. A bright start to the game for the hosts, who are being given plenty of time and space down that right-hand flank so far."
34,9 min,"Woodburn takes over set-piece duties, sending in a flat free kick for Sonogo'o to awkwardly flick to safety. Plymouth sitting back too much at the moment, which is making life far easier for Liverpool than it should be."
35,11 min,"First we have seen from Argyle in an attacking sense, as Slew sends in a ball that is half cleared to the edge of the box. The ball did not fall for Jervis to hit, but that did not stop 9,000 of those away fans from getting excited."
36,13 min,"SHOT! Stewart with Liverpool's second attempt of the match, following in the steps of Ejaria early on, as the Reds continue to dominate proceedings. Can't criticise Plymouth for sitting back, but they are way too deep at the moment."
37,15 min,"Plymouth defend Liverpool's latest corner, but they will have a chance to shoot from a free kick 18 yards out after Carey caught Stewart with a high boot. Can and Moreno usher away the younger pros - fair to say they do not intend to cross it!"
38,17 min,"CHANCE! First real opening of the match for Liverpool. Having blocked Can's free kick, the ball fell nicely to Ojo from the second ball into the box, but he did nothing with it and merely headed straight at McCormick."
39,19 min,"SAVE! Ben Woodburn is played into some space inside the box. The Wales age-grade star did well to set himself up for the shot but, under pressure from three opposition players, he rushed his attempt and was thwarted by McCormick down low."
40,21 min,"So incredibly easy for Liverpool in the opening quarter of this game. The Reds were always likely to dominate possession, but I was hoping to see a little more from the visitors - just one attack from them inside the opening 21 minutes."
41,23 min,"GOAL DISALLOWED! Origi sticks the ball in the net to seemingly give Liverpool a deserved lead, but the referee had already blown his whistle after the striker grappled with Miller in the build-up to the strike."
42,25 min,"A little more balance to the game since that disallowed Origi strike, but Plymouth still largely sitting back in the hope of soaking up the pressure. Moreno sends in a good cross for Origi to control, though it is soon taken over by Woodburn who just ran out of space to shoot."
43,27 min,"Argyle fans urging their side on, as this game continues to follow the same theme; Liverpool completely dominating and being allowed to play at their own pace. Hard to criticise the visitors, though, because it is still goalless."
44,29 min,"The ball sits up for Stewart to hit on the edge of the box, which he sends a yard or so wide of the target. Plenty of attempts from the Reds but just the one half-chance so far, squandered by Ojo midway through the half."
45,31 min,"Alexander-Arnold is pretty much the game's most lively player so far, constantly getting in behind his man and sending in a few decent deliveries. The latest on is held on to by McCormick at his front post - Liverpool's umpteenth attack of the match."
46,33 min,"Got to wonder whether Adams will tinker with things at the break. This is a weakened Liverpool side - their youngest ever, at that - and Argyle must offer some sort of attacking intent in the second half of this game. Another shot comes in, this time deflected behind."
47,35 min,"The corner comes in and Miller, perhaps unsighted by the sun, nods anxiously wide of his own post. Eleven goal attempts for Liverpool in the opening 35 minutes of the game; not a single attempt of any sort for their opponents."
48,37 min,"Liverpool win another free kick around 25 yards from goal, which Origi sends straight into the wall. That is followed up by  corner kick number six of the match that McCormick holds on to when Moreno eventually sends it in."
49,39 min,"An astonishing stat that sums up Plymouth's gameplan - they completed 21 passes in the opening 37 minutes of the match. That has near enough doubled over a 60-second period of possession, which their fans respond to with some cheers."
50,41 min,"Half time now just four minutes away, so it is job done for Adams as far as his gameplan is concerned. Klopp will no be all that happy, with his side completely dominating things but creating very little - hardly surprising when up against a team with 10 outfield defenders."
51,43 min,"Ojo looked to get the beating of Slew down the right, but when looking to cut inside he was blocked off the ball. Half time now a minute or two away, with Klopp potentially thinking about making a change at the midway point."
52,45 min,"Real panic for the visitors, as Moreno chips a ball into the box that initially looked to be dealt with. It only fell as far as Ejaria, however, who rifled a shot against a green shirt. Plymouth break, win themselves a free kick but do little with it."
53,45+1 min,HALF TIME: LIVERPOOL 0-0 PLYMOUTH ARGYLE
54,2.21pm,"That half-time whistle is blown by referee Paul Tierney, bringing a close to one of the most one-sided halves of football you are ever likely to see. The only shock is that Liverpool have yet to open the scoring, but that may well change should Klopp turn to one of Firmino, Sturridge or Lallana at the break."
55,2.24pm,"Liverpool saw three-quarters of the ball in the first half and racked up a total of 12 attempts in all, but clear-cut openings proved to be few and far between for the dominant hosts. Ovie Ejaria and Kevin Stewart were both wayward with their long-range efforts, while Seyi Ojo could only head right into the hands of Luke McCormick when a chance had finally been carved out."
56,2.27pm,"The closest Liverpool came to making their dominance count in the opening 45 minutes arrived at the feet of Ben Woodburn midway through, though he was thwarted by McCormick at the front post after initially doing well to work some space for the shot. Home fans thought the deadlock had been breached after Divock Origi tucked the ball home, only for the referee to disallow it for a challenge on Gary Miller in the build-up."
57,2.30pm,"Plymouth did not muster a single attempt in the first half and incredibly only completed 21 passes in the opening 27 minutes of the match, focusing purely on getting bodies behind the ball to frustrate the inexperienced Liverpool side. That may have worked in the first half, so you have to say it is job done on that front, but how much longer can they keep their opponents out? Let us remind ourselves of the two benches at this midway point.LIVERPOOL SUBS: Mignolet, Klavan, Clyne, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Firmino, SturridgePLYMOUTH ARGYLE SUBS: Bulvitis, Smith, Goodwillie, Osborne, Rooney, Dorel, Tanner© SilverHub"
58,46 min,"RESTART! We are back up and running on Merseyside, where Klopp has opted against changing things around at the break. Sturridge, Lallana and Firmino all waiting in the wings, remember, with the Reds desperate to avoid a replay - or worse!"
59,48 min,Fifty-three passes completed by Argyle overall in the first half - fewer than Reds midfielder Stewart on his own. An early cross in sent in from out wide for McCormick to collect. Klopp will likely wait until the hour before making those changes.
60,50 min,A rare chance for Plymouth to put their opponents under pressure - and I stress the word rare - but Carey swings a deep free kick right into the path of Karius. Certainly seeing a little more from the visitors in an attacking sense this half.
61,52 min,"I'm counting this as a shot from Plymouth - their first of the match. Slew looked to put his foot through it from 30 yards out but got the contact all wrong, sending it closer to the corner flag than Karius's goal."
62,54 min,"Really surprised that Klopp has not changed things. I know he is reluctant to bring on those first-team regulars, with an EFL Cup semi and league clash with Man United to come, but drawing - or indeed losing - this match would be close to disastrous."
63,56 min,"CLOSE! Ojo rises highest to get his head on a left-sided cross, which is glanced narrowly wide of the far post. A small shout for a penalty from home fans, but replays prove inconclusive. Something to give those supporters a chance to get out of their seats, at least!"
64,58 min,"SAVE! Plymouth enjoying themselves far more in this second half, as Carey sends a free kick from all of 35 yards right down the middle for Karius to collect. Up the other end, Woodburn is unable to make the most of a tough opening."
65,60 min,"SAVE! Lucas is given all the space in the world 25 yards from goal and decided to take on the shot, which was hit well enough but did not have enough precision to get the beating of McCormick. An hour in, surely those changes will now be made."
66,62 min,"Sturridge has been summoned by Klopp, stripping out of his training gear and preparing to come on. Liverpool have been far too decisive in the final third in the first two thirds of this match, but that may now be about to change."
67,64 min,"Garita, with tape galore on his legs following his recent knee injury, goes down without any sort of contact. A minute or so of treatment later he trudges off the pitch - whether he will return or not for the remainder is unclear at the moment."
68,66 min,"LIVERPOOL SUB! Klopp made that first substitution a minute or so ago, bringing on Sturridge for Can - a striker for a midfielder. Expect to see the Reds up things now, as they have been in first gear for too long."
69,68 min,"CLOSE! Only one thing in Sturridge's mind when picked out 20 yards from goal - shoot! He was not too far away, either, as the ball ended just inches wide of the target, though McCormick may have had it covered. Tanner now on for the injured Garita."
70,70 min,"Plymouth's most promising moment of the match so far, as Tanner works some space and drives into the box. The substitute took the shot on, which was blocked aside with two teammates up alongside him in better positions."
71,72 min,"Ejaria the latest to be frustrated when closed down on the edge of the box. Sturridge keeps his cool and so very nearly picked out Ojo's run behind, but it had too much on it and McCormick was there first. Time fast running out now."
72,74 min,"A real dearth of quality in this second half from Liverpool, summed up by Moreno's lacklustre free kick towards the front post. Now just 15 minutes or so to go at Anfield, so could we see Firmino and/or Lallana in the coming minutes?"
73,76 min,"Miller lands awkwardly on his ankle and his afternoon is quite clearly over. A few minutes of time now being eaten up while he receives some treatment, giving Klopp a chance to usher Lallana and Firmino back to the touchline."
74,78 min,"LIVERPOOL SUBS! Lallana and Firmino are indeed on for the closing 12 minutes or so, taking the places of Woodburn and Ejaria. Miller receives a warm reception as he is stretched off the field with that ankle injury; Smith on in his place in defence."
75,80 min,"All three changes made by Klopp now, then, all three of whom add real Premier League class to this Reds side. Plymouth look to stun Liverpool, but Stewart got across well to deny Tanner bursting clean through on goal."
76,82 min,"Two of the subs combine; Firmino sending the ball in for Sturridge to head on to the roof of the net. Those Plymouth fans are really starting to believe now, as we have eight minutes to go and the Reds barely look like scoring."
77,84 min,"Lallana with a fine delivery into the box for Origi to head, but the Belgian just failed to get any purchase on the ball. Another small shout for a penalty, but he was hardly grappled to the ground and referee Paul Tierney made the right call."
78,86 min,Sturridge almost catches everyone by surprise when cutting inside on his left and blasting the post narrowly wide of the target. Only two teams - West Ham and Man United - have stopped Liverpool from scoring on home soil over the past 12 months.
79,88 min,"Jervis's eyes must have lit up when he got in behind, but in the end he could neither find the target not pick out Tanner alongside him, sending a disappointing shot-cross wide of the target. McCormick catches a cross up the other end to eat up some further seconds."
80,90 min,"Normal time is now officially up at Anfield, but six minutes of time has been added on at the end. A few groans ring around Anfield as a poor cross is sent into the box for McCormick to pounce. A third-round replay now surely beckons."
81,90+2 min,"Those Plymouth fans have dropped their volume levels a tad over the past minute or so, no doubt too busy biting their nails as we enter the final four minutes of the match. A great effort from them in this second half, finding more of a balance between defending and attacking."
82,90+4 min,"Alexander-Arnold sees his hopes of shooting from the edge of the box thwarted, but Slew shoves Ojo off the ball and Liverpool have perhaps one final chance to send the ball in, which Smith deflected onto goal to force a stop out of McCormick."
83,90+6 min,FULL TIME: LIVERPOOL 0-0 PLYMOUTH ARGYLE
84,3.28pm,"Plymouth Argyle see out the final few seconds, with Lucas Leiva's thumping shot failing to test McCormick between the sticks. The Pilgrims now have a third-round replay to look forward to in a little over a week's time, while for Liverpool their month has now become even more congested - nine games in all for them in January."
85,3.30pm,"That concludes Sports Mole's live text coverage of events at Anfield. Before heading off why not check out this on-the-whistle match report of events on Merseyside, while updates from the day's other FA Cup fixtures can be found here. Enjoy!"
