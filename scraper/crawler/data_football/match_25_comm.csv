13,2.47pm,The players are just warming up at the Estadio Municipal de La Línea de la Concepcion under a grey sky - which is nonetheless clearing up somewhat - and in windy conditions. Not long to go now before the action gets underway.
14,2.50pm,"PREDICTION: With it being a mid-season friendly, the game will obviously be a fair bit more relaxed than a competitive game, but I still fancy the Bundesliga side to edge their Dutch opponents - I reckon 2-0 to Dortmund."
15,1 min,"KICKOFF: A few minutes behind schedule, but we're finally underway here at the Estadio Municipal."

20,20 min,"And we have the breakthrough in this game as Reus makes amends for his unsuccessful penalty by getting on the scoresheet after all, marauding into the box and slotting the ball through the legs of an opposition defender and into the net!"
21,25 min,"Nearly half an hour played and, safe for that earlier half-chance from Zinchenko, it's been virtually all Dortmund so far, dominating possession and proving slicker on the ball and more incisive in the final third."
22,30 min,"CHANCE! Spoke too soon maybe? PSV piece together a great attacking move which culminates in Ramselaar getting into space and rifling an effort towards goal, but the ball soars above the bar."
23,40 min,GOAL! DORTMUND 2-0 PSV (SHINJI KAGAWA)
24,42 min,"Thomas Tuchel's charges double their lead not long before half time, and it's a mistake from Arias who loses possession in dangerous territory, and Kagawa is on hand to claim the ball and slot past Zoet."

27,3.59pm,"As predicted, it's not been a particularly high-tempo game, with both sides more concerned about fitness and easing their way back into action ahead of the second half of the season, but Dortmund have been calling the shots, with PSV offering little in response."
28,4.04pm,"Oleksandr Zinchenko, on loan from Manchester City, came closest for the Eredivisie side in the 14th minute, while Bart Ramselaar fired over the bar on the half-hour mark, but Dortmund have been more impressive all-round and could have been three goals to the good had Marco Reus netted his penalty just after the quarter-hour mark."
