0,6.46pm,"Evening all! Sports Mole's live La Liga coverage continues from Camp Nou as Spanish champions Barcelona welcome Espanyol for the much-anticipated Catalan derby. Barcelona will once again be the favourites to overcome their rivals, but Quique Flores's Espanyol are currently on a nine-game unbeaten run in the league, which has seen them rise into the top half of the table. Should be a good one!"
1,6.49pm,"Espanyol have not beaten Barcelona in the league since a 2-1 victory at Camp Nou in February 2009 – losing 11 of their 14 meetings since then. That run of form includes a 5-0 defeat in the corresponding league match last season, while they also lost to their rivals over two legs in the Copa del Rey. They met four times in all competitions last season and Espanyol only scored once."
2,6.52pm,"Right, without further ado, let me bring you up-to-speed with the all-important team news from Camp Nou. Espanyol have had a free week to play for this match, but Barcelona were out in Qatar on Tuesday to play a lucrative friendly against Al Ahli, which they won 5-3. Right, let's have a look..."
3,6.55pm,"TEAMS!BARCA: Ter Stegen; Roberto, Pique, Mascherano, Alba; Busquets, Denis, Iniesta; Neymar, Suarez, MessiESP: D.Lopez; J.Lopez, D.Lopez, Reyes, Martin; Piatti, Fuego, Diop, Jurado; Caicedo, Moreno"
4,6.58pm,"Jeremy Mathieu is Barcelona's only first-team absentee at the moment, leaving Luis Enrique with plenty of options all over the park. Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez continue in the final third, but there is a slight surprise in midfield as Denis Suarez is chosen over Ivan Rakitic. Sergi Roberto, meanwhile, continues at right-back, leaving Samuel Umtiti on the bench alongside Lucas Digne.© SilverHub"
5,7.02pm,"As for Espanyol, Leo Bapistao's absence opens up a spot in the final third for Felipe Caicedo, who scored his first league goal of the season against Sporting Gijon last weekend. Pape Drop started the Sporting clash on the bench, but the midfielder returns tonight to start alongside Javi Fuego in the centre of the park. Pablo Piatti and Jose Jurado continue in the wide areas for the Catalan side."
6,7.05pm,"So there we have it. The two teams are in and we are now just about 40 minutes from kickoff on this mild evening in Barcelona. I shall speak about the away side and their impressive form a little bit later, but let's start with the hosts. Real Madrid's participation and indeed triumph in the 2016 Club World Cup means that Zinedine Zidane's league leaders are not in action this weekend and as a result, Barcelona have the chance to cut the gap at the top of the table to just three points."
7,7.08pm,"Nine wins, four draws and two defeats have brought Barcelona 31 La Liga points this season. They have scored 37 times in Spain's top flight – second behind Real Madrid – and conceded 15 times, which is a poorer defensive record than Real Madrid, Villarreal and Atletico Madrid. As things stand, they are six points off the summit and indeed two points behind second-place Sevilla.© SilverHub"
8,7.12pm,"Barcelona's first league defeat of the season occurred at home to Alaves on September 10, before they lost 4-3 at Celta Vigo at the start of October. They are unbeaten in the league since then, but have dropped points in three of their eight league matches. Indeed, between November 19 and December 3, they drew three straight games against Malaga, Real Sociedad and Real Madrid."
9,7.15pm,"The Catalan giants did return to winning ways last weekend, however, as they put three unanswered goals past struggling Osasuna. They also comfortably booked their spot in the knockout round of the Champions League after topping a group that also included Manchester City and will take on French champions Paris Saint-Germain over two legs in February/March 2017."
10,7.18pm,"In terms of what is ahead for Barcelona, they will welcome Hercules to Camp Nou for the second leg of their Copa del Rey clash on Wednesday night, with the score level at 1-1 from the first leg. Enrique's side then have a break until January 8, where they return to league action away to Villarreal, who have once again been impressive in the opening months of the season.© SilverHub"
11,7.22pm,"Barcelona have not won either of their last two league games at Camp Nou, but they have not gone three in a row without a victory at home since December 2003. What's more, a certain Lionel Messi has scored 14 times against Espanyol in La Liga and the Argentine has been in red-hot form this season – netting 22 goals in 19 appearances for his Spanish club. He's quite good, Messi."
12,7.25pm,"As for Espanyol, Quique Flores's side made a really poor start to the season, but they are currently on a nine-game unbeaten run in the league, which has seen them rise from the bottom three to ninth spot in the table. Indeed, as things stand, they are just one point off seventh position."
13,7.28pm,"Espanyol lost three of their first six in the league earlier this season – recording just one win in the process – but they are unbeaten in Spain's top flight since a 2-0 defeat to Celta Vigo on September 25. Since the Celta match, they have played nine times in the league - recording four wins and five draws. Incredibly, only Barcelona and Real Madrid have lost fewer league matches than Espanyol this season.© Getty Images"
14,7.32pm,"Four wins have arrived in Espanyol's last six league matches, with victories over Real Betis, Alaves, Leganes and Sporting Gijon joined by draws against Athletic Bilbao and Atletico Madrid. Indeed, they played very well away to Diego Simeone's Atletico earlier this month and had chances to collect all the points from the Vicente Calderon, but kept another clean sheet in a goalless draw."
15,7.35pm,"Espanyol will enter this match off the back of a 2-1 win over Sporting Gijon last weekend and a run of six league away games unbeaten is their best form since December 2007. What's more, the Periquitos have kept a clean sheet in each of their last four away games in La Liga, but they have never gone five in a row in this particular competition. Flores is making some impression at the club."
16,7.38pm,"Experienced goalkeeper Diego Lopez has earned widespread praise for his brilliant form this season, but Espanyol have also had a number of impressive performers down the other end. Gerard Moreno has contributed five league goals this term, Leo Baptistao three, but the club's leading scorer this term is Pablo Piatti on five. Last weekend, Felipe Caicedo finally registered his first league goal of the campaign in the 2-1 victory at home to Gijon and the powerful forward starts tonight."
17,7.42pm,"7 - Barcelona have won the last seven league games at Camp Nou against Espanyol with an average of 3.1 goals scored. Derby. pic.twitter.com/unvJDFGjLQ— OptaJose (@OptaJose) December 18, 2016 "
18,7.44pm,"Here we go then - both sets of players have joined us on the pitch ahead of kickoff. Barcelona have really enjoyed recent derbies against Espanyol, but you just get the feeling that this could be a very uncomfortable night for the home side. Be sure to stay tuned for minute-by-minute updates!"
19,0 min,KICKOFF! Barcelona kick things off on home soil...
20,2 min,"... Barcelona will dominate possession tonight, but Espanyol have plenty of players that can cause problems on the counter-attack. Indeed, it is very much a 4-4-2 formation for the visitors, which is not something you see too often from an opposing team at Camp Nou. Brave if nothing else!"
21,4 min,"As expected, Barcelona are in control of the possession as they look to build from a deep position. However, Espanyol are nice and solid at the back and have kept the home side at bay thus far here."
22,6 min,"We have not seen too much from Neymar, Suarez and Messi in the opening six minutes, which is credit to Espanyol for their shape. You just get the feeling that the first goal tonight - if there indeed is one - could be vital. If Barcelona manage to take the lead, Espanyol will be drawn out."
23,8 min,"Super feet from the youngster Martin as he dances past a couple of Barcelona challenges before looking to feed Caicedo, but the striker was in an offside position. The visitors then break down the other side with the skipper Javi Lopez, but Alba does enough to force the number 16 off balance."
24,8 min,"CLOSE! Suddenly Barcelona burst into life as Suarez races away from a couple of challenges before feeding Neymar, who delivers a low cross into Messi, but the Argentine misses the target. Wonderful combination between the three players and it was almost a sensational goal."
25,10 min,BOOKING! Piatti (Espanyol) is booked for a late tackle on Iniesta.
26,12 min,"Just the one clear chance in the opening 12 minutes of this match, with Messi firing wide of the post from close range. Espanyol are really threatening when they have the chance to break, however, and Roberto has to come across to block a Jurado cross, which had pace and direction."
27,13 min,BOOKING! Martin (Espanyol) is booked for a late tackle on Messi.
28,16 min,"As expected, Espanyol are proving a tough nut to crack for Barcelona tonight. The visitors are also causing problems when they have the chance to break forward, but just need to be careful after picking up a couple of early bookings. Still goalless with 16 minutes on the clock at Camp Nou."
29,17 min,"Half-chance for Espanyol as Martin finds Moreno with a super cross, but the striker's header was always moving wide of the post. Moreno was too powerful for Alba there."
30,18 min,GOAL! Barcelona 1-0 Espanyol (Suarez)
31,19 min,Barcelona make the breakthrough in the 18th minute as Iniesta delivers a sensational pass into Suarez and the striker races into the box before slotting the ball under Diego Lopez.
32,21 min,"Espanyol impressed in the early stages of this match, but they need to be careful that this does not get away from them as Barcelona continue to pass and probe. The next goal tonight - if there indeed is one - will be absolutely crucial. The visitors just cannot afford to concede a second."
33,23 min,"Just a reminder that Espanyol are currently on a run of nine games unbeaten in the league, but that is going to be tested in this match. Not too much to report in terms of chances in the last few moments, although Barcelona are in control of the possession as they continue to pass and probe."
34,24 min,Barcelona have a free kick in a dangerous area as Reyes fells Suarez...
35,25 min,... Messi strikes the set piece straight into the Espanyol wall.
36,27 min,Espanyol cannot seem to keep hold of Suarez at the moment as the striker continues to run off Lopez and Reyes in central defence. Iniesta is also being afforded too much time on the ball.
37,28 min,Espanyol have the chance to threaten from a set piece as Alba raises his leg into Moreno...
38,29 min,"... Jurado delivers into the Barcelona box, but there are no takers and the home side can break."
39,29 min,"CLOSE! Barcelona come close to scoring a second as Neymar feeds Messi just inside the box, but the Argentine fires just wide of the post. Espanyol had David Lopez on the ground down the other end and there would have been some serious words if that one had gone in!"
40,32 min,"Little over 10 minutes of the first period remaining and Barcelona lead courtesy of Suarez, who finished a terrific long pass from Iniesta. The away side have had their moments on the counter-attack, although clear chances have been at a premium. It is still delicately poised here."
41,34 min,"Just a reminder that a win for Barcelona would see the Spanish champions regain second position from Sevilla and move to within three points of Real Madrid, who would still have a game in hand. Iniesta is running the show for the home side as he continues to produce stunning passes from deep."
42,36 min,"In fairness to Espanyol, they have tightened up at the back in the last five or 10 minutes and Barcelona are finding it difficult to pick holes. The visitors are not really threatening down the other end, however, with Caicedo and Moreno struggling to make their mark. Still 1-0 Barcelona here."
43,38 min,"Half-chance for Espanyol as Javi Lopez finds space in a wide position, but the defender's effort was always wide of the post. Moments before, Busquets hit the deck after a strong challenge from Caicedo and the Spanish midfielder takes a while to return to his feet. He's a powerful man Caicedo."
44,41 min,"Not too much to report in terms of chances in the last few minutes, with Espanyol dealing with everything that Barcelona are throwing at them. The home side manage to put together a brilliant passing move involving Iniesta, Messi and Suarez, but Fuego makes a really key challenge."
45,43 min,"Barcelona put the pressure on with another set piece from a dangerous position, but Diop makes an important clearance and Espanyol survive the little period of pressure that follows."
46,45 min,Espanyol could do with the half-time break as they continue to concede possession in dangerous positions. A second for Barcelona at this stage would be a massive blow to their chances.
47,45 min+1,"Half-chance for Barcelona as Suarez tries to go through David Lopez inside the Espanyol box, but the ball just bounces away from the striker and Espanyol have a goal kick in stoppage time."
48,45 min+2,HALF-TIME: Barcelona 1-0 Espanyol
49,8.33pm,"So there we have it. The referee brings the first period to a close with Barcelona leading Espanyol 1-0 courtesy of Suarez's goal in the 18th minute. Espanyol have had some decent moments on the counter-attack, but the Spanish champions deserve to enter the half-time interval with a lead."
50,8.38pm,"STATISTICS! Barcelona have dominated the possession with 67%, while they have managed five shots, but just one of those - Suarez's goal - was on target. Espanyol, meanwhile, failed to hit the target with any of their three first-half attempts. Two bookings to report - Piatti and Martin for the visitors."
51,8.43pm,"BENCH WATCH! Rafinha, Digne, Alcacer, Rakitic, Turan and Umtiti are the outfield players available for Barcelona tonight and it would not be a surprise to see at least a couple of those in the second period. Espanyol, meanwhile, have options in the shape of Jose Antonio Reyes and Alvaro Vasquez."
52,8.48pm,Suarez has celebrated his new long-term deal with a goal tonight...© SilverHub
53,46 min,RESTART! Espanyol resume the action here...
54,47 min,"... no changes from either side at the break, which is not too much of a surprise. However, you suspect that both managers will have alterations in mind as the second period develops here."
55,49 min,"If Espanyol are going to pick up a positive result tonight then they surely cannot afford to concede a second goal. As long as it remains 1-0, the visitors will be in the match, but Barcelona are looking to double their tally and Messi has just sent a powerful effort wide of Diego Lopez's post."
56,51 min,"SAVE! Wonderful save from Diego Lopez as the experienced goalkeeper keeps out a low strike from Suarez, who had once again been released by Messi. Eye-of-the-needle pass!"
57,52 min,Espanyol are going to have to change their goalkeeper here as Diego Lopez stays down.
58,53 min,"No-one is quite sure what has happened to Diego Lopez, but it does not look great and Roberto is getting ready to enter the field. Might well be some sort of ligament damage to his knee."
59,53 min,"ESPANYOL SUB! Roberto replaces Diego Lopez between the sticks. The good news is that Diego Lopez did walk off the field, but he has definitely injured his knee in some capacity."
60,55 min,"Neymar shows sensational feet in a tight area to drive between two defenders, but Piatti is having none of it and chops the Brazilian to the deck. Barcelona really want that second goal here."
61,57 min,"Neymar has the chance to cause Espanyol problems from a set piece in a wide position, but the Brazilian fires over the crossbar, much to the disappointment of Pique, who had gone forward. Little over 30 minutes of this Catalan derby remaining and Barcelona still lead by one goal."
62,60 min,Not an awful lot to report in terms of chances in the last few moments and we are entering the period of the match where both managers will be considering alterations. Piatti gets himself in a race with Ter Stegen following a long punt forward and Ter Stegen has the pace to get there.
63,62 min,"The referee has been busy in the last couple of minutes following some late challenges, but still just the two yellow cards in this match, which is a very low for a Catalan derby, that is for sure."
64,64 min,"Espanyol are taking a few chances now, but that is leaving space for Barcelona to exploit. Neymar does brilliantly to work some space in the final third before looking to find Suarez, but Reyes makes a vital block and the danger is cleared. Suarez's goal remains the difference at Camp Nou."
65,65 min,BOOKING! Caicedo (Espanyol) is booked for a lunge on Messi.
66,66 min,BARCELONA SUB! Rafinha replaces Denis Suarez for the home side.
67,67 min,GOAL! Barcelona 2-0 Espanyol (Suarez)
68,68 min,"Suarez has his second of the match, but this goal is all about Messi. It is just wonderful from the Argentine as he dances through a whole host of challenges before firing at Roberto and the goalkeeper can only palm towards Suarez, who was never going to miss from that position!"
69,68 min,GOAL! Barcelona 3-0 Espanyol (Alba)
70,69 min,Oh my word! Again it is sensational from Messi as the Argentine skips past a few challenges before poking towards Alba and the left-back beats Roberto from a wide position. Two quick-fire goals!
71,72 min,ESPANYOL SUB! Melendo replaces Caicedo for the away side.
72,74 min,"Stoppage in play as Alba and Piatti clash knees, which is never nice! You have to feel for Espanyol, who were actually quite comfortable at 1-0, but Messi has just absolutely destroyed them."
73,75 min,BARCELONA SUB! Umtiti replaces Busquets for the home side.
74,77 min,Little over 10 minutes of the second period remaining and Espanyol just want this game to be over as Barcelona continue to move the ball in the final third. Neymar and Messi both wants goals.
75,79 min,GOAL! Barcelona 3-1 Espanyol (David Lopez)
76,80 min,What a goal! Espanyol are on the scoresheet here as Moreno cushions a lovely pass into the full-back David Lopez and he curls one into the top corner. What a lovely piece of football that was!
77,81 min,ESPANYOL SUB! Reyes replaces Piatti for the away side.
78,83 min,"Neymar again breaks through for the home side after a super pass from Messi, but the offside flag was raised and Espanyol can breathe again. Little over five minutes remaining at Camp Nou."
79,86 min,Brilliant challenge from David Lopez as the Espanyol defender manages to get a foot to the ball when Neymar was driving into the away side's box. I still fancy there to be another goal tonight.
80,87 min,Messi just misses the far post after dancing into the Espanyol box once again!
81,89 min,"Neymar might not have found the back of the net tonight, but the Brazilian has been key to Barcelona securing all the points. Espanyol have really struggled to contain the home side's front three and they will not be the last team this season. Messi has been different class again."
82,90 min,Reyes chips a free kick over the far post as Espanyol waste a dangerous set piece.
83,90 min,GOAL! Barcelona 4-1 Espanyol (Messi)
84,90 min+1,"Barcelona have their fourth as Messi converts through Roberto's legs after driving away from the Espanyol defence and combining with Suarez, who found his teammate with a super pass."
85,90 min+2,We are into the second of five additional minutes at Camp Nou.
86,90 min+4,Espanyol would rather be anywhere else at the moment as Barcelona search for more goals in the final stages of this match. Messi and Suarez have been too good for the visitors tonight.
87,90 min+5,FULL-TIME: Barcelona 4-1 Espanyol
88,9.40pm,"So there we have it. The referee brings the second period to a close with Barcelona running out 4-1 winners over Espanyol at Camp Nou to jump above Sevilla into second spot in the table. The champions are now just three points behind league leaders Real Madrid, although Los Blancos have a game in hand. Thanks for joining Sports Mole for the live action once again. Until next time!"
