Chase-master Kohli beefs up record against Pakistan
Another India-Pakistan clash has come to an end and once again, it's India who have prevailed. They now extend their domination in the marquee tournament across formats to a scarcely believable 11 - 0. Shahid Afridi's men once again didn't have an answer to Virat Kohli's brilliance. The man is head and shoulder above the rest of the world when it comes to chasing in the shorter formats. Here are a few stats highlights from the India-Pakistan clash at Kolkata on Saturday (March 19).

-11-0 India have beaten Pakistan in 11 head-to-head matches in World Cups, across formats. The run started in 1992 at Sydney when Imran Khan's Pakistan lost to Mohammad Azharuddin's India.

- Pakistan's 11-0 is the worst record for a top eight team in World Cups (50 over and 20 over) against a particular opposition. All other teams have beaten their opposition at least once in the marquee tournament.

- India have finally beaten Pakistan in Kolkata in a limited overs international match. They had ended up on the losing side in all the four One-Day Internationals (ODIs) between the two sides played at the Eden Gardens.

- Ahmed Shehzad (24 years 117 days), when batting on seven, became the second youngest after Umar Akmal (23 years 180 days) to reach 1000 runs in T20 Internationals. Pakistan now have five batsmen with 1000 plus runs in T20Is. India are next best with four. All the nine players featured in the Kolkata match.

- Afridi has featured in 83 matches against India across formats. Only Sachin Tendulkar (87) has played more often in India-Pakistan encounters. Afridi's 93 matches against Sri Lanka is the most for a Pakistan player against an opposition.

- Umar Akmal scored a five in Friday's match when Ravindra Jadeja throw ricocheted off the stumps to the mid-wicket boundary. The batsmen to do so before him in World T20s are Xavier Marshall, Kamran Akmal and Brendon McCullum.

- It was the first time Mohammad Hafeez batted at number seven in a T20I in 75 innings. In his entire career, he has batted below number three only six times.

- Suresh Raina has failed to score a T20I 50 in his last 33 innings. His last half-century came against Zimbabwe in June 2010.

-Kohli has now gone past the 20-run mark in chases 18 times in as many innings. McCullum has also crossed the 20-run mark 18 times but it took 38 innings.

- India scored 29 runs in the first six overs. It is their third-worst in World T20s in six overs after 24 against Australia at Bridgetown in 2010 and 28 in the last match against New Zealand.

- Kohli has 14 fifties in T20Is - the most by any player. He surpassed Chris Gayle, McCullum and Tillakaratne Dilshan - all of whom have 13 each.

- The 61-run partnership between Kohli and Yuvraj Singh was the fourth-best for the fourth wicket for India in T20Is and third-best in chases - all three involving Kohli. All the four have come against Pakistan.

- Kohli's average of 83.60 is the best for anyone in T20I chases with a minimum of 300 runs. Michael Hussey is next best with an average of 52.62, well behind Kohli's.

- Kohli has won four Man of the Match awards in World T20s in only 13 matches. Only Gayle, Mahela Jayawardene and Shane Watson with five each are ahead of him.

- This is Kohli's third Man of the Match against Pakistan in the last four T20Is between the two nations in multi nation tournaments. His scores in these four matches read 78*, 36*, 49 and 55*.
