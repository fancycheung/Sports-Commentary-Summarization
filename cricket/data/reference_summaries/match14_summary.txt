Fletcher smashes records with his unbeaten 84
West Indies blew away Sri Lanka without a Gaylestorm in the Group 1 encounter at the Chinnaswamy Stadium on Sunday (March 20). Andre Fletcher was the man of the moment for West Indies at Bangalore. He opened the batting in place of an injured Chris Gayle and anchored the tricky chase scoring two-third of the team's runs in the process. The West Indian spin duo of Samuel Badree and Suleiman Benn proved too much for the inexperienced Sri Lankan batting line up. A brief look into the stats for the match.
