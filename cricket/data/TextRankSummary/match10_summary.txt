full, Marsh drills it to long-onThat was not a good back-up over from Santner, after Sodhi bowled a 1-run over.16.6Santner to Ashton Agar, SIX, promoted ahead of Faulkner and Agar does some justice to the captain's call.Flighted delivery on the stumps, Agar steps out, gets to the pitch of the ball and goes back over the bowler's head and finds the sightscreen16.5Santner to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, sensibly Marsh taps it to point and gets off strike16.4Santner to Mitchell Marsh, SIX, New Zealand can't relax until this man is at the crease.Not to the pitch of the ball after advancing, yet goes

the front foot and opens the face of the bat at the last moment to guide it fine, but picks out short third man13.1Ish Sodhi to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, short delivery on the stumps, Marsh softly pulls to deep mid-wicketIsh Sodhi [1.0-0-4-0] is back into the attack14 off that over, just what Australia wanted, but not convincing enough as a couple of boundaries came off inside-edges.12.6Milne to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, slower delivery to round off the over, Marsh chops the cut towards point12.5Milne to Maxwell, 1 run, Milne cramps Maxwell for room as he goes leg-side, the slower ball as

cover-point12.3Milne to Maxwell, wide, now Milne strays down the leg-side, he's done that for the second time in the over and not sure about the idea as fine leg is inside the ring.He wanted to flick this, got what looked a leading edge, went more off the outside half of the bat, Guptill rushed from deep mid-wicket and even dived, but the ball didn't carry to him11.5Corey Anderson to Mitchell

contact, the ball rolls into the on-side off the keeper's pad10.4Santner to Maxwell, no run, oh big turn!On seeing the ball being dropped short, Maxwell went back to work it on the on-side, but the
