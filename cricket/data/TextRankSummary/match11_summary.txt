Twenty 20s.- South Africa beat England 2-0 the last time these two met in South Africa last month.- After winning the trophy in 2010, England have won just three matches out of ten in the subsequent World T20s.- England has failed to defend 171 and 182 in their last two games - the most they failed to defend in their entire T20I history.- Faf du Plessis needs five more runs to reach 1000 runs and if he gets there tomorrow, he would be the joint second fastest with Kevin Pietersen and Alex Hales (32 innings each).- Imran Tahir has a strike rate of 14.9 against test playing nations in T20Is - the best for a player with minimum 30 wickets and featuring in 2016 World T20.Where did England go wrong?There is quite a headache for the team management at the top of the batting order, with AB de Villiers promoted up the order, and Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla already in the mix, only two of three can claim the opening slots.18:15 Local Time, 12:45 GMT, 18:15 IST: The second big game of the day and it is England taking on South Africa.
