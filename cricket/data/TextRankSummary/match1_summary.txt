Zimbabwe lost one to HPCA XI and had a saunter against Ireland.Key players: Hamilton Masakadza, Malcolm Waller, Sean Williams, Elton Chigumbura.Hong Kong: Currently placed 14th in the ICC T20I rankings.>>> This is the third time (2012, 2014 and 2016) Hong Kong are taking part in the ICC World T20 qualifiers.The inclusion of Ryan Campbell in the side should be a shot in the arm for the side bereft of exposure at the biggest stage, and Hong Kong will hope that Campbell, alongside Mark Chapman and Babar Hayat, the other promising batsmen in the line-up, deliver the goods and help the side punch above their weight.
