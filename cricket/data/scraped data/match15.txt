That nearly wraps things up. Australia have notched up the win and they should hope that it's only upwards from here. Geographically, at least, it is. They travel to Mohali where they will face Pakistan on the 25th. While on the other hand, Bangladesh have disappointed in the tournament so far. Big things were expected of them. But then their team has been hit with one jolt after other as unrest has prevailed. First the suspension of Taskin and Sunny, and then Tamim reporting sick today. Got to feel for them. Anyway, that's it from us. Until tomorrow, it's goodbye. Cheers!Mortaza: "We knew the first six overs will be crucial. It's a big scoring ground. Fielding and bowling could have been better. Mahmudullah played well and also Mithun and Shakib. It's two losses in a row but we have two matches and need to play hard and see what happens."Smith: "We made it difficult for ourselves in the end. Bangladesh bowled well in the middle and took a few wickets. One of the top four needed to kick on and make it clinical. We have been losing wickets in clumps in the middle so something to work on. Pitches are different from what we are used to in the IPL - where the wickets are good. Something we need to get used to. We have to be at our best to beat India."Zampa: "Nice to make a difference. It's nice to get the tournament off and rolling. I've been playing in front of 80000 people in the BBL, so it's something you get used to. Have played 3-4 games here now so getting used to. Have had a little bit of travel, off to Mohali now. Hopefully it'll be nice."Adam Zampa is the Man of the Match It's comprehensive enough a win as the Aussies never really looked to be in danger of losing it at any stage. Bangladesh needed early wickets at the top to defend but their endeavour met nothing but failure as Khawaja took flight. He shoved caution to the dogs as he went after everything in a usually strokeful innings. The maiden T20I fifty was scaled and he put Australia in a position of control despite not kicking on. Bangladesh hit with wickets towards the latter half of the chase but never really threatened to topple the Kangaroos as cameos from Maxwell and Warner took them close enough to the finish line. What didn't help Bangladesh's cause were the dropped chances, missed run-outs, which littered the innings. Being the form team coming into the tournament, it's been a sorry show in the Super 10s.18.3Saqlain Sajib to Faulkner, FOUR, and he's wrapped it off. Sajib once again puts it short and finds himself slapped through extra-cover. Done deal. Australia win by 3 wickets18.2Saqlain Sajib to Faulkner, no run, grips and turns square from a length on middle, Faulkner waits on the back foot and pats it away18.1Saqlain Sajib to Nevill, 1 run, looped up on off, and SENSIBLY pushed to long-offSaqlain Sajib [3.0-0-35-0] is back into the attackPeter Nevill, right handed bat, comes to the crease17.6Shakib to Hastings, out Caught by Soumya Sarkar!! Australia are left with just 3 wickets now. Let's take a second to discern Hastings's shot. What's his mindset? Are they taking a win for granted? Because that has to be priority, right? Sees the flight, goes for the slog and holes out at deep mid-wicket. They are adding unnecessary drama. Hastings c Soumya Sarkar b Shakib 3(4)Shakib to Hastings, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!17.5Shakib to Hastings, 2 runs, and Rahim has fluffed a run-out opportunity. Hastings might have still made it, but I guess we'll never know. Swatted wide of deep mid-wicket off a thick edge, Hastings is struggling on the second and the throw is a fairly good one. It's only drawback being that it's bounced too close to Rahim to make him commit the error17.4Shakib to Faulkner, 1 run, sliding down leg, nurdled through square17.3Shakib to Hastings, 1 run, oh my! Al-Amin has messed up at extra-cover. Fairly simple chance moving to his left. and it pops out of the palms. Hastings is done in by the flight and dip and chips it in the air and gets away17.2Shakib to Hastings, no run, tossed up on off, forward and blockedJohn Hastings, right handed bat, comes to the crease17.1Shakib to Maxwell, out Stumped!! Shakib stumps Maxwell with a slider. He comes running down the track. Shakib knows. And he slips it in shorter and skids it past the inside edge of Maxwell's slog. Rahim completes the burial neatly. Maxwell st Rahim b Shakib 26(15) [4s-2 6s-2]Shakib to Maxwell, THAT'S OUT!! Stumped!!Shakib Al Hasan [3.0-0-23-1] is back into the attackNine runs are left. Australia will surely look to work on their Net Run Rate.16.6Mustafizur Rahman to Maxwell, 1 run, short of length slower ball on leg, holds up on Maxwell's pull and he knocks it off the toe-end through mid-wicket16.5Mustafizur Rahman to Maxwell, SIX, and he's been punched over wide long-on. Has he again employed a seam up ball? Can't say as it's too full. But Maxwell has hit it sweetly16.4Mustafizur Rahman to Maxwell, no run, keep doing this. Off-cutter kicks and grips from a short of length and stuns Maxwell as he tries to block. Beats the edge16.3Mustafizur Rahman to Maxwell, SIX, Maxwell flogs Mustafizur over deep backward square. Mustafizur deviates from his cutters and bowls a seam up on the pads, and Maxwell's wrists come down on it so hardJames Faulkner, right handed bat, comes to the crease16.2Mustafizur Rahman to Mitchell Marsh, out Caught by Shakib!! Completely and utterly hoodwinked by the off-cutter. He's not the first one tonight to be duped by Mustafizur. Pushes at it but then has to check his shot. Can't do so and spoons it behind backward point where Shakib runs back and stretches both hands to grab. Mitchell Marsh c Shakib b Mustafizur Rahman 6(6) [4s-1]Mustafizur Rahman to Mitchell Marsh, THAT'S OUT!! Caught!!16.1Mustafizur Rahman to Mitchell Marsh, no run, cuts away from a length and skirts past Marsh's outside edge as he tries to angle it into the off-sideWhat can Bangladesh do? Well, delay the inevitable for a start. 22 from 24.Mustafizur Rahman [3.0-0-17-1] is back into the attack15.6Saqlain Sajib to Maxwell, FOUR, latches onto a floaty full toss and slices it over extra-cover. It's over15.5Saqlain Sajib to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, gently driven wide of the diving extra-cover to long-off15.4Saqlain Sajib to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, two boundaries in the over and time is running out for Bangladesh. It's short again, not as much as the previous one and the line is closer to middle. Marsh backs away, allows it to turn and punches it strongly through the covers. The fielder in the deep gets there with a slide but then it deflects off his legs into the cushions15.3Saqlain Sajib to Maxwell, 1 run, tossed up very full wide of off, driven hard to deep cover15.2Saqlain Sajib to Maxwell, FOUR, he's released all the pressure, if there was any. Drops it short and well wide of off, Maxwell picks his spot and slaps it through extra-cover15.1Saqlain Sajib to Maxwell, no run, nearly yorks himself after stepping out, the bottom hand comes off as he squeezes a drive to extra-coverSaqlain Sajib [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attack14.6Shakib to Maxwell, 1 run, looped up outside off, driven after a forward press to long-off14.5Shakib to Maxwell, no run, turned to mid-wicket14.4Shakib to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, stays flat-footed while driving with the turn through the covers14.3Shakib to Mitchell Marsh, no run, patted back to the bowlerMitchell Marsh, right handed bat, comes to the crease14.2Shakib to Warner, out Caught&Bowled!! Warner hits a full toss straight back to Shakib. Moves away from the line of it to create room, and can only hit it off the toe-end. Shakib does well to keep his composure, and not get intimidated by the batswing. Ha, replays suggest he wasn't even looking at the ball and it nearly bobbled out. Keeps the hope cannister alive. Warner c and b Shakib 17(9) [4s-1 6s-1]Shakib to Warner, THAT'S OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!14.1Shakib to Warner, no run, darted into the blockhole from round the wicket, squeezed back to the bowlerShakib Al Hasan [2.0-0-21-0] is back into the attackOnly a little more than a run a ball. 38 from 36.13.6Al-Amin to Maxwell, 2 runs, Maxwell is on the hop and his feet are off the ground as he clips a leg-cutter behind square. Got it right off the bottom of the bat as there is hardly much bounce. But places it between two fielders for a couple13.5Al-Amin to Warner, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off, swatted to deep mid-wicket13.4Al-Amin to Maxwell, 1 run, back of a length delivery wide of off, Maxwell slices it to third man13.3Al-Amin to Maxwell, no run, length ball driven to mid-off13.2Al-Amin to Maxwell, no run, that's a snorter first ball. Banged short outside off and vaults up to send Maxwell hopping. He does well to sway away from the line and drop his gloves at the last secondGlenn Maxwell, right handed bat, comes to the crease13.1Al-Amin to Khawaja, out Bowled!! He's walked across so far that the leg-stump has been pinged. Very strange. Especially from a batsman batting on 58. Tries to clip it away after getting inside the line. Fails to put bat to ball to a very innocuous delivery and has to walk back. Brilliant knock though. Khawaja b Al-Amin 58(45) [4s-7 6s-1]Al-Amin to Khawaja, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!Al-Amin Hossain [1.0-0-10-0] is back into the attack12.6Mahmudullah to Warner, 2 runs, short on the stumps, grips appreciably and finds Warner waiting on the crease. Allows it to turn and chips it to the right of long-on. The fielder isn't able to ride the bounce as the ball lands just in front of him and makes only a half-stop. Back for two12.6Mahmudullah to Warner, wide, slung down leg, Warner is happy to collect the wide12.5Mahmudullah to Khawaja, 1 run, flatter outside off, punched through the covers12.4Mahmudullah to Warner, 1 run, flatter and short outside off, cut towards extra-cover who fumbles12.3Mahmudullah to Warner, 2 runs, tucks it in front of deep mid-wicket and he's quicker than Watson, absolutely races back for a couple to beat the throw12.2Mahmudullah to Warner, SIX, flat-batted over wide long-off. He's leaning towards the leg side, the ball is turning wide of off, and he just goes through with a forehanded loft and it clears the fence. Stunning12.1Mahmudullah to Warner, FOUR, absolutely swats the pull wide of long-on. Sees the length being short and smashes it from outside off. Mid-wicket wasn't far away but he hardly movedMahmudullah [1.0-0-5-0] is back into the attack11.6Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, no run, another cutter, very full outside off, Khawaja leans towards it and squeezes it to cover11.5Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, 2 runs, gently nudges a full toss through mid-wicket and places it in the gap for a brace11.4Mustafizur Rahman to Warner, 1 run, off-cutter on a length outside off, Warner goes with all hands and chops it through the coversIn walks Davey Warner. They'll keep coming.David Warner, left handed bat, comes to the crease11.3Mustafizur Rahman to Smith, out Bowled!! Smith is out of here! Done in by a pacy yorker which he tries to play across the line after shuffling to off, only to find the stumps rattled. It went through his legs. Bangladesh keep themselves afloat. Only just. Smith b Mustafizur Rahman 14(13) [6s-1]Mustafizur Rahman to Smith, THAT'S OUT!! Bowled!!11.2Mustafizur Rahman to Smith, no run, stands on off and tries to pick an off-cutter through the on-side, misses, and Mustafizur gets excited. Nothing going for the LBW appeal though. Pitching outside leg and missing off11.1Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, 1 run, full on off and Khawaja drives it with a closed bat to long-onMustafizur Rahman [2.0-0-13-0] is back into the attack10.6Saqlain Sajib to Khawaja, 1 run, spinning in towards the pads, clipped through square leg10.5Saqlain Sajib to Smith, 1 run, tucked away through square leg10.5Saqlain Sajib to Khawaja, 2 wides, Sajib expects him to come out and darts it down leg. Khawaja stays put and collects a wide. Then is called through by Smith as Rahim has deflected it to short fine legSome tomfoolery going on. Khawaja dances out and Sajib pulls out. Then Khawaja moves away when Sajib is twirling in. Gamesmanship10.4Saqlain Sajib to Smith, 1 run, he's on the move again and clips it to long-on10.3Saqlain Sajib to Smith, no run, flatter and pins him to the crease, blocked to leg10.2Saqlain Sajib to Smith, SIX, that's classic Smith. He ran past Santner in the previous game. That doesn't deter him. Hops out of the crease, meets the pitch and flows into the loft over long-off10.1Saqlain Sajib to Khawaja, 1 run, creates his own length by sliding deep in the crease, back-cuts it to the right of deep point for a singleSaqlain Sajib [1.0-0-9-0] is back into the attack9.6Shuvagata to Khawaja, 1 run, rolls the wrists to pick a ball from off and nudge it to long-on9.5Shuvagata to Khawaja, FOUR, Khawaja roars to a fifty with a smashing cut shot. It's too short from Hom and offers width as well. Slapped away in front of backward point9.4Shuvagata to Smith, 1 run, ventures out and whips a flighted ball to long-on9.3Shuvagata to Khawaja, leg byes, 1 run, darts it onto the pad seeing him come out, Khawaja is late on the whip and picks a leg-bye9.2Shuvagata to Khawaja, no run, slightly squared up. Hom angled it in from round the wicket, then got it to turn and catch a thick outside edge towards short third man9.1Shuvagata to Smith, 1 run, plays back to a full ball on off, pushes it to long-offAustralia are still in control despite losing Watson. Khawaja going along smoothly and lots of batting to come8.6Shakib to Smith, 1 run, allows the ball to turn after using the depth of the crease and drives off the back foot to long-on8.5Shakib to Khawaja, 1 run, gently sweeps a ball drifting across him to deep mid-wicket all along the ground8.4Shakib to Smith, 1 run, skips out of the crease and pushes it to long-on8.3Shakib to Smith, no run, stomps forward to a flighted ball and blocks it back8.2Shakib to Khawaja, 1 run, sliding on across off, tucked through mid-wicket8.1Shakib to Khawaja, FOUR, that roundarm action from Shakib drifts it very wide of off, allows Khawaja the room to free the arms after camping back and he slaps it well in front of square to beat the man in the deepShakib Al Hasan [1.0-0-13-0] is back into the attack7.6Shuvagata to Khawaja, 1 run, drifts one in on middle, flicked through mid-wicket7.5Shuvagata to Smith, 1 run, picked off the pads through the on-side7.4Shuvagata to Khawaja, 1 run, shimmies down to get close enough to the ball and nudges through mid-wicket7.3Shuvagata to Smith, 1 run, darted on the pads, tucked behind squareSteven Smith, right handed bat, comes to the crease7.2Shuvagata to Watson, out Watson Run Out!! 1 run completed! Watson pulls it wide of deep mid-wicket and wants two. It's his call and now he has to put in the big strides to make it back. Looks to be labouring. The throw is a good one, rocketed on top of the bails. Third umpire called for and he's atleast 3-4 inches short. Excellent throw from Rahman. Caught him completely off-guard. Watson run out (S Rahman/Rahim) 21(15) [4s-2 6s-1]Shuvagata to Watson, THAT'S OUT!! Run Out!!7.1Shuvagata to Khawaja, 1 run, tries to pick a ball from outside off to leg, the ball turns and the leading edge trickles through extra-coverShuvagata Hom, comes into the attack6.6Saqlain Sajib to Watson, SIX, he's held his charge back until Sajib releases, then shimmies down and mows the flighted ball wide of long-on with his pumping forearms6.5Saqlain Sajib to Watson, no run, stays back and blocks6.4Saqlain Sajib to Watson, no run, flatter and skidding on quickly outside off, Watson cuts and chops it off the under edge to short third man6.3Saqlain Sajib to Khawaja, 1 run, rocks back to a shortish length and pulls to deep backward square6.2Saqlain Sajib to Watson, 1 run, drops it short and turns it wide, slapped to deep cover6.1Saqlain Sajib to Khawaja, 1 run, fired on the pads, flicked through mid-wicketSaqlain Sajib, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack5.6Mustafizur Rahman to Watson, no run, Mustafizur dupes Watson with an off-cutter and he's skied it miles off a leading edge. Who wants it? Mithun is setting himself underneath at mid-wicket, looks nervous, and ends up having to dive full length. And he barely got a hand. There's a run-out chance now. But Mortaza can't fire the stumps down. All happening5.5Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, 1 run, works a ball towards mid-on and sets off for a quick runOh no. Mustafizur is clutching his left side, which had kept him out of the World T20 until now.5.4Mustafizur Rahman to Watson, 1 run, stands tall and nudges a short of length delivery in front of mid-on5.3Mustafizur Rahman to Watson, no run, back of a length delivery outside off, patted to point5.2Mustafizur Rahman to Watson, FOUR, he's dabbed that. A simple dab. Waited for the back of a length off-cutter to slant away, then ran it off the open-face wide of gully and fine of third man5.1Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, 1 run, off-cutter on a good length, holds up on Khawaja as he tries to drive through the off-side, the bat turns and he spoons it in the air towards long-on4.6Shakib to Khawaja, 1 run, he's got lucky now. Shakib lobbed it up and pulled the length back. Khawaja came dashing out and swung hard despite not meeting the pitch, the ball turns and finds the inside edge towards short fine leg4.5Shakib to Khawaja, FOUR, down on one knee and swept away to the left of deep mid-wicket. The fielder moves across, and slips at the inoppurtune moment to see the ball bounce over him4.4Shakib to Khawaja, FOUR, Shakib drifts one across Khawaja now as he dances down, but only aids in giving room for a swing of the arms. Khawaja carves it over mid-off4.3Shakib to Khawaja, FOUR, shimmies down to get close to the ball and then allows his wrists to take over. Whips it strongly wide of long-on4.2Shakib to Khawaja, no run, too full to be sweeping. Might have premeditated it and the ball sneaks under him and wasn't far away from off either4.1Shakib to Khawaja, no run, drops it short and slants it wide from round the wicket, breathes a sigh of relief as Khawaja's cut finds pointShakib Al Hasan, left-arm orthodox, comes into the attack3.6Mustafizur Rahman to Watson, FOUR, outside edge skims away over backward point and beats third man. Watson sees it land on a good length and tries to loft it downtown. Has to reach out in the end as the ball holds up slightly and cuts away. Flies off the thick edge3.5Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, leg byes, 1 run, lucky to not be punished. Fine leg is up and he bowls it on the hips. Khawaja can only deflect it off the thigh pad3.4Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, no run, fullish and another off-cutter perhaps which dips in to sneak past Khawaja's inside edge onto the pad. Again going down leg3.3Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, no run, hurls a yorker wide of off and Khawaja has ventured too far down leg to even attempt a stroke3.2Mustafizur Rahman to Khawaja, no run, fast and full and hits the pad before breaking into a scream for LBW. It's going down leg with the angle3.1Mustafizur Rahman to Watson, 1 run, here's the famous cutter, on a short of length and gripping away from off, Watson steers it to third man3.1Mustafizur Rahman to Watson, wide, and he starts with a wide. Angled away well wide of off, Watson isn't interestedMustafizur is BACK!Mustafizur Rahman, left-arm fast medium comes into the attack2.6Al-Amin to Khawaja, FOUR, lots of intent from Khawaja. Again comes running towards Al-Amin who is pressurized into bowling it short and wide. Flashes it in the air off the bottom of the bat and places it wide of cover. Lucky it didn't go to hand2.5Al-Amin to Watson, 1 run, very full around off and Watson scampers away after jamming it in front of mid-off2.4Al-Amin to Khawaja, 1 run, angled into the hips, tucked behind square2.3Al-Amin to Khawaja, no run, charges at him while moving away from the line of the ball to make room, and chops it in front of point due to the lack of bounce. The fielder swoops in, gathers and loses control of the ball while shying at the non-striker's end. Save your blushesAl-Amin will bowl round the wicket now..2.2Al-Amin to Khawaja, FOUR, that's an easy put away. Short of length, rises only as high as the waist and Khawaja pulls it with a dash of disdain past short fine leg2.1Al-Amin to Khawaja, no run, slants it wide of off and Khawaja flows into a drive, hits it to coverAl-Amin Hossain, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack1.6Mahmudullah to Khawaja, 1 run, dances down and Mahmudullah slows the pace, tosses it nicely and nearly yorks Khawaja, squeezed wide of mid-on where there's a fumble1.5Mahmudullah to Watson, 1 run, this is the idea. To give no room. Clipped off the pads to deep mid-wicketGoes round the wicket to Watson now..1.4Mahmudullah to Khawaja, 1 run, plays back to a slider on middle and tucks it through mid-wicket1.3Mahmudullah to Watson, 1 run, plonks the front foot down to a flighted off-break and gently drives wide of mid-off1.2Mahmudullah to Watson, no run, flatter outside off, slides on, punched to extra-cover1.1Mahmudullah to Khawaja, 1 run, looped up on a length outside off, Khawaja drives it past a diving extra-cover down to long-off. There was extra bounce and he got it high up on the bat but went through with itMahmudullah, right-arm off break, comes into the attackBangladesh don't waste any time in turning to spin. Mahmudullah from round the wicket...0.6Mortaza to Khawaja, 1 run, short of length and pulled away over square leg. There is protection in the deep and it will just be a single0.5Mortaza to Khawaja, no run, resorts to the off-cutter, grips the pitch from a length on off, and rips past the outside edge as Khawaja aims a loose cover-drive0.4Mortaza to Khawaja, SIX, good grief! That's an astonishing stroke. Fullish and Khawaja lays into it. Just lofts through the line with a big flourish and it soars over long-on0.3Mortaza to Khawaja, 2 runs, it's an off-cutter down leg, sticks in the pitch as Khawaja tries to flick, runs away off the leading edge straight of mid-off and an easy coupleBoth fine leg and third man are up. Expect plenty of cutters and pace off the ball0.2Mortaza to Khawaja, no run, short of length on the body, Khawaja moves inside the line and glances to short fine leg0.1Mortaza to Khawaja, no run, shabby start. Short, wide and utter filth. It's so wide that Khawaja has to reach out with his back foot, still can only get his slash off the toe-end to short third manKhawaja and Watson are at the crease. Khawaja is on strike. Mortaza will open the attackKhawaja skips out to race past Watson as they head to the centre. He put on a dazzling display in the Powerplay overs in Dharamsala before the pitch hindered his freedom. Let's see how he goes. Mortaza will begin proceedings with a slip..Average score batting first in the last 5 completed T20s here has been 199. In comparison, Bangladesh's score looks underwhelming. But generally the pitches here facilitate strokeplay. This one takes turn. And with Bangladesh's buffet of spinners, you never know. Shakib already has a ball in his hands on the sidelines. No dew right now I am being informed, and Bangladesh look upbeat.Bangladesh will be pleased with the final score. 44 runs from the last three overs has boosted this total. They never quite got going at the top, Soumya Sarkar fell cheaply, so did Sabbir Rahman. Mohammad Mithun briefly threatened but when Shuvagata Hom was dismissed - the score read a sorry 78/4. Shakib started the counter-attack, but it was Mahmudullah and Rahim who shored up with some late hitting. It's less than a par score on this ground, but Bangladesh have something to defend. Can Australia chase the target down? Join us in a while..19.6Coulter-Nile to Mahmudullah, 1 run, low full toss from Coulter-Nile, drilled back towards the bowler. Coulter-Nile pushes his hands across and deflects it towards mid-on, just a single. Bangladesh finish with 15619.5Coulter-Nile to Mahmudullah, no run, Coulter-Nile goes for the wide yorker and lands it just inside the tramlines, Mahmudullah can't reach out for the drive, a valuable dot ball19.4Coulter-Nile to Mahmudullah, 2 runs, Coulter-Nile shortens his length as Mahmudullah came down the track, pulled wide of long-on, comes back for the second run, brings up the 50-run stand as well19.3Coulter-Nile to Mahmudullah, FOUR, this is a stunning knock from Mahmudullah, length delivery on the stumps, Mahmudullah clears his left leg, the balance is perfect as he lifts it over mid-wicket, pressure on the bowler19.2Coulter-Nile to Mahmudullah, FOUR, nicely played by Mahmudullah, mid-off was up and Mahmudullah clears him. On a good length and just outside off, Mahmudullah backs away and lifts it over the infield, one bounce and over the ropes19.1Coulter-Nile to Rahim, 1 run, back of a length slower delivery outside off, Rahim was backing away and mistimes the cut towards point, just a singleNathan Coulter-Nile [3.0-0-9-0] is back into the attack18.6Watson to Mahmudullah, FOUR, 17 from the over, massive over for Bangladesh. Now, can they get to 160? The bouncer from Watson, Mahmudullah swivels across, uses the pace on the ball and helps it behind square on the on-side, beats fine leg to his left. A fine cameo from Bangladesh's finisher18.5Watson to Rahim, 1 run, banged in short and just outside off, Rahim comes down the track, makes room as he did so and slaps it over point, one bounce and to the man in the deepSmith has a word with his bowler and effects changes to the field.

This was the drifter from Zampa, pushed through flatter and went straight on, Hom was looking to nudge it towards the on-side, ends up playing right across the line, once he missed, it was curtains, gets struck bang in front of middle, would have crashed into the stumps. Easy call for umpire Gould. Shuvagata lbw b Zampa 13(10) [4s-1 6s-1]Zampa to Shuvagata, THAT'S OUT!!

That's a soft soft dismissal for Mithun, he's upset as he walks away. This was a rank long hop from Zampa, dragged it halfway down the pitch, Mithun could have hit it anywhere, instead, he rocks back and pulls it straight down the throat of Watson at deep mid-wicket. He doesn't drop those, the partnership was beginning to look dangerous, but that has been snapped up now. Mithun c Watson b Zampa 23(22) [4s-1 6s-1]Zampa to Mithun, THAT'S OUT!!

Second wicket for Watson and the dangerous Rahman departs!

Faulkner made good ground, dived across and held a low catch. Bangladesh are in some trouble now. S Rahman c Faulkner b Watson 12(17) [4s-2]Watson to S Rahman, THAT'S OUT!!

- Australia have won all their three games, all coming in World T20s, against Bangladesh in T20Is

- Australia have lost six of their last seven matches in World T20. Their only win came against Bangladesh in 2014.

- Australia are yet to win a T20I in India. They have lost to India in 2007 & 2013 and to New Zealand at Dharamsala on Friday

- The average score batting first in the last five completed T20 matches at Chinnaswamy Stadium is 199

- 8, 7, 4, 2, 1, 13 - Shane Watson's last six scores in World T20. In the four matches prior to it he scored 51, 41*, 72 & 70 and won four consecutive Man of the Match awards.06:30pm local: If you believe this game to be a one-sided thumping, you are either ignorant or you just don't know the current cricket dynamics. Fuse Bangladesh's form with Australia's spin handicap, discount Bangaldesh's miseries and multiply all of it with Australia's Kiwi-inflicted wounds - now you see the picture. Chinnaswamy will spin; everything is in India - including yarn, wheels, records. And heads. BCB are indeed in a catch-22 situation: the bowlers were disallowed by the ICC and now BCB has approached the ICC (at least visibly) for a repeal. We'll wait for ICC's magnanimity test but what's certain is that the two bowlers aren't playing tonight in what will be a battle between two hurt teams. Bangladesh were grounded by Pakistan at the Eden Gardens, located a few hundreds of kilometers from Dhaka. This match is their lifeline - a loss will handicap their residual chances but a win has the potential to shock and surprise. Australia were rather humbled in a close-ish game at Dharamsala and they need to end their India hoodoo. When was the last time they won here?6:22pm local: Kaushik pings me that Finch is having throw downs. He is not sure about the player he will replace. He seldom is. Also, Ashton Agar is golf-swinging a stray bat. Is that enough to suggest that he's not playing? Go figure.6:15pm local: World T20. Near home conditions. An in-form Asia Cup finalist. And that team's still struggling. Go figure. Having been thrown into a Associate wrestling ring, Bangladesh sailed through comfortably into the Super 10s only to find a stumbling block. A speed-breaker that can potentially fizzle out their campaign and fight. Taskin Ahmed and Arafat Sunny, the two bowlers who had never been cotton-wooled in long sleeves, were suddenly found to be bowling with suspect actions and banned with immediate effect. Imagine a tyre puncture before an interview. Now imagine losing two key bowlers before the business end of a global tournament kicks in. "It's tough being me," Kevin Pietersen had said once. So says Bangladesh now. Or they at least seem to be saying so. A hello and welcome from Pratyush Sinha to another Chinnaswamy buffet of shots, spin and spectators.Preview by Kaushik Rangarajan

Similar yet so very different - the underlying theme of the Group 2 clash between Bangladesh and Australia, to be played at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Monday (March 21). Similar because both teams come into the fixture at the back of defeats. Another reverse would severely debilitate the losing team's chances of making out of an intricately poised group. Different because while Australia have acknowledged the predicament caused by the New Zealand defeat, Bangladesh's strategy has been thrown off following suspensions to their lead pacer Taskin Ahmed and the left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny.

On the eve of the match, even as a relatively subdued Bangladesh went about their drills at the 'B' ground of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) Stadium, Australia chose to stay put in their hotel room, presumably to conserve energy ahead of what promises to be a hectic couple of weeks. The conditions in Bengaluru are not alien to their players - short boundaries, true pitch, lots of runs. There are, however, question marks, over the T20 pedigree of this side. Steven Smith has adopted a 'flexibility' mantra for his side. This has led to a batting order reshuffle and unclear role definitions for the playing eleven, clearly disturbing the balance of the side.

If a bulk of the Australian players have Indian Premier League (IPL) experience to moot, Bangladesh's players have an 'A' tour of India late last year, one that featured several of the senior team members, to thank for their apparent familiarity with the conditions. Mashrafe Mortaza's men couldn't have asked for a better time to play an Australian side still grappling with the idea of T20 combinations, but off-field developments threaten to leave them under-cooked for a crucial clash.

When: Australia vs Bangladesh, March 21, Group 2 - 19:00 IST
Where: M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru
What to expect: A stark contrast to what Australia encountered in Dharamsala - Lower altitude, easy-paced wicket and certainly no hailstorms.

Team News:

Australia

Aaron Finch was Australia's T20 captain barely two months ago. Steven Smith took over in order to ensure continuity after the former picked up a hamstring injury. As luck would have it, when the Super 10 phase of the World T20 got underway this past week, he was the one giving up his spot as the selectors sought to fit Shane Watson and Usman Khawaja in the top-order. A return to the top of the order for the former captain would be mooted as would the inclusion of Josh Hazlewood in place of the second spinner, Ashton Agar, who infamously conceded 18 in his opening over against a marauding Martin Guptill.

Bangladesh

"Even if Mustafizur Rahman is 20% fit, he will have to play. We have no options," opined a sombre-looking Mortaza on the eve of the match. With two of his best bowlers suspended, Bangladesh's biggest challenge would be to stitch together a bowling unit that can serve the rigors of bowling on a surface that comes with a reputation for being rather unkind to the bowlers. Mustafizur will return for the first time since sustaining a side strain in the Asia Cup encounter against Sri Lanka, and Nasir Hossain, who scored a 100 and a bagged five-fer in of the one-dayers during the A tour could take up Sunny's spot.

What they said:

Steven Smith: It's a tough group, there are some very good sides in our group. Obviously we didn't start as well as we would have liked the other night against New Zealand. It's in the past now. We know what we need to do now - we need to win every game we play if we want to win the World Cup.

Mashrafe Mortaza: He (Chandrika Hathurasinghe) knows a lot about the Australian players during his time with New South Wales. Obviously, we will be seeking a lot of tips from him. The plans are there but the main thing is to execute them. We know that Australia can destroy any team.
