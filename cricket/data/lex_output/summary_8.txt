Once Gayle goes like that, it's hard to stop him.Their bowlers mixed it up well and didn't allow us to get going on what was a good batting surface.It's a good wicket to bat second as well.And that is quite an achievement.18.1Topley to A Russell, 1 run, not like this.This has been a lot to take.Not after all we've seen.Gently14.6Jordan to Gayle, wide, tries another slower ball but it's well down leg.36 off 33.Although Gayle fails to connect, runs away fine off the pad13.1Moeen Ali to Gayle, no run, flatter on the stumps from round the wicket, patted back to the bowler12.6Topley to A Russell, FOUR, back of the hand slower ball very wide of off, Russell is down on one knee and stretching out to reach.Once he does, his hands take over and hoist it over extra-cover12.6Topley to A Russell, wide, loses control of the angle and slips it down leg12.5Topley to A Russell, no run, slower short of length delivery around off from round the wicket, patted to backward point12.4Topley to Gayle, 1 run, toe-ends the drive over Topley and it's through him before his hands go up in reflex.Very full on the stumps and Gayle is early into the shot.Stokes is not that man.Slower ball which is very wide outside off, wided10.3Stokes to Gayle, no run, aggression from Stokes.Stop the match, England would say6.1Adil Rashid to Samuels, 1 run, looped up around off, Samuels moves his front leg out of the way and squeezes a drive to deep cover.Through the stroke too early and lobs it off the toe-end in front of long-off4.6Stokes to Samuels, no-ball, caught at backward point, but it's a very high full toss outside off, Samuels slashed it from around chest height I think.All that movement by Samuels is really putting Stokes off.Pitch right up just outside off, and it's so full that there is no scope of late movement.Gayle's bat comes down hard and he mauls it over the infield1.2Topley to Gayle, no run, squared up by the movement as he pokes at a good length delivery well away from the body, adjusts and steers it to backward point1.1Topley to Gayle, no run, tries to invite an extravagant drive with a tempting outswinger outside off, Gayle lets it goReece Topley, left-arm fast medium, comes into the attack0.6Willey to Samuels, no run, length ball shaping in from middle, nudged to mid-on0.5Willey to Samuels, FOUR, drops a half-volley on the pads now, and is put away.HawkEye shows it trimming the bailsMarlon Samuels, right handed bat, comes to the crease0.2Willey to Charles, out Caught by Moeen Ali!!Willey has the ball.Run Out!Morgan was deceived by that, he is early into the flick, checks his shot and the ball balloons on the leg-side, drops in front of the incoming long-on fielder18.4A Russell to Stokes, 1 run, just short of yorker length, Stokes gets it off the inside half of the bat to deep mid-wicket as he tries to mow it across the line18.3A Russell to Stokes, SIX, he has middled this.Banged in halfway down the wicket, Morgan at no point in time looked to keep the pull down, hit it in the air and it went soaring over the long leg fence for a maximum14.4A Russell to Buttler, 1 run, back of a length on off, Buttler shuffles across, gets inside the line and tucks it to deep mid-wicket.Just short of good length and on middle, Root moves away to the leg-side, tries to go over mid-off, gets it almost off the bottom of the bat, spoons a simple catch to Taylor at mid-off.On off-stump, Hales fetches it from there and whips it behind square, beating deep square leg comfortably8.5Brathwaite to Root, 1 run, once more comes down the track and yorks himself this time, digs it to the right of the bowler and down to long-on8.4Brathwaite to Root, FOUR, there was not a boundary scored for a while and Root knew that.Bravo starts with an off-speed delivery, on middle, Hales flicks it behind square leg, Russell had 25 yards to cover according to Russell Arnold and he gets there with a dive, hauls it in and saves a run for the teamDwayne Bravo, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack4.6A Russell to Root, no run, back of a length and just outside off, Root stands tall and crunches the punch, picks out Charles at backward point, either side and that would have been four more4.6A Russell to Root, wide, another one down leg.Flighted on the stumps, Hales kneels down to play the sweep, gets it right off the base of the bat, dribbles away to deep mid-wicket1.1Badree to Jason Roy, 1 run, immediately Roy is down wicket, sees a bit of flight and rushes out of the crease, takes it on the full and drives it down to long-onSamuel Badree, right-arm leg break, comes into the attackWest Indies already look sharp in the field.Here we go...The flags of both the sides are out and so are the players.We played one warm-up game here and it was a good cricket wicket.However, this time they do.
