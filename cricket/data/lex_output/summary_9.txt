man1.2Hamid to Chandimal, no run, that's taken flight from a length outside off.Chameera circled around the ball, he never looked like he would take it, just about got his fingertips and shelled it19.1Kulasekara to Dawlat Zadran, 2 runs, low full toss on Zadran's pads, clipped away in front of square on the on-side, the fielder at mid-wicket gets across, puts in the dive and saves a couple of

flat and hard, Thirimanne runs in, gets down low and completes the catch.Shenwari had his base set very early, got down on one knee, actually he was beaten for pace for a wee bit, but manages to

that?Sadiq c Chandimal b T Perera 0(7)T Perera to Sadiq, THAT'S OUT!!!7.6Chameera to Stanikzai, no run, full and slanting into Stanikzai's pads, he was early into the tuck, almost closed the bat face and gets a soft leading edge that rolls towards Dilshan at backward point7.5Chameera to Ali Zadran, leg byes, 1 run, appeal for LBW, but the height might have been an issue.Zadran shuffled across to a straight ball as he looked to whip and missed, gets hit high on the pads, the impact was in front of middle, but the angle might have been taking it down leg as well7.4Chameera to Ali Zadran, no run, on a good length and just outside off, Zadran presses forward with an angled bat and gets an inside edge back towards the bowler7.3Chameera to Ali Zadran, no run, the bouncer from Chameera, Zadran got inside the line and was looking to help it past the keeper, misses it completely.He thought it was too high, but the umpire calls it as one for the over7.2Chameera to Stanikzai, 1 run, back of a length and just outside off, extra bounce for Chameera, might have been the slower ball.Pitch looks to be on the dry side but I don't think it will change too much."Stanikzai: "We'll bat first.Here they are in the Super 10 of the 2016 World T20.Can they upset a side in their group?Well, now that they are playing Sri Lanka, one might as well say that they have a golden opportunity to do so.Preview:Once we get that, we will be very hard to beat."
