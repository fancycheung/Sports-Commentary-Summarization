If we had taken our chances, it would have been a close game."Sammy: "We always had some close battles with Sri Lanka.Chris is like a local, hopefully for the rest of the tournament, they come out and support us in the same way.That meant he couldn't open and eventually West Indies did not need him, much to the disappointment of the crowd.Well, Chris Gayle comes out and waves to the crowd.They want to see him bat.Full toss outside off stump, Russell goes straight back over the bowler's head for a boundary16.2Kulasekara to Andre Fletcher, 1 run, the full toss is driven down to long-on16.1Kulasekara to Andre Fletcher, no run, oh he's kicked that ball away from the stumps to avoid being bowled.A mis-hit from Fletcher, but he gets away with it.Siriwardana will not like the fact that he went too full for this flighted delivery, Fletcher got under it and lofted it over the fenceSo Sri Lanka's frontline spinners have both bowled out.What was that Denesh Ramdin?Fletcher went hard on the inside-out drive and took the man at cover out of the equation, the fielder dived but it was too quick for him10.2Siriwardana to Ramdin, 1 run, shortish, cut square of the wicket on the off-side10.1Siriwardana to Ramdin, no run, huuuuge shout for LBW.A couple of wickets here could make things very interesting.9.6Herath to Andre Fletcher, no run, appeal for LBW, but going down.Flighted delivery outside off stump, Samuels steps out, doesn't get to the pitch of the ball, yet goes for the drive and runs past it.What a ball that is!Sri Lanka have their first breakthrough and the players are delighted.That was too close to the stumps and the shot was not on.Andre Fletcher is on strike.Join us back as a potentially easy chase beckons Gayle and Co.19.6Dwayne Bravo to Jeffrey Vandersay, leg byes, 1 run, appeal for a caught behind, but it went straight off Vandersay's pads, another slower ball from Bravo, Vandersay was shuffling across as he looked to play the paddle sweep, missed and the ball lobbed off the flap of the pads.Sri Lanka end up with 122Dushmantha Chameera, right handed bat, comes to the crease19.5Dwayne Bravo to T Perera, out Caught by A Russell!!Herath was always struggling, we don't even need to go to the third umpire here.Russell has a wicket as well!!7.6Brathwaite to Mathews, no run, full toss from Brathwaite, that was a gift from the bowler, but Mathews has been very defensive so far and only pats it towards cover7.5Brathwaite to Kapugedera, leg byes, 1 run, fuller length delivery and on Kapugedera's pads, he was looking to flick and missed, sneaks in a leg-bye as the ball rolls away towards the on-side7.5Brathwaite to Kapugedera, wide, aborted appeal for a caught behind, but the umpire isn't amused as he signals a wide.This was pushed through flatter and just outside off, Chandimal backed away on the cut, hits it to the left of cover-point and set-off for a quick single, Thirimanne wasn't budging though, asks his partner to rush back.Chandimal run out (Charles/Ramdin) 16(18) [4s-1 6s-1]Badree to Chandimal, THAT'S OUT!!Brathwaite strikes with his first ball, Dilshan isn't happy one bit, but he has to go.This was full and angled back into the right-hander, Dilshan got his left leg out of the way as he aimed to slog it over mid-wicket, missed it completely and got struck bang in front of middle and leg, was pretty deep in his crease as well.This is T20.Fresh off convincing victories in their respective opening matches of ICC World Twenty20, 2016, West Indies and Sri Lanka will be eager to extend the momentum when they lock horns at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Sunday (March 20).Sri Lanka lead West Indies 5-1 in World T20s.Gayle has scored just 76 runs in five T20Is against Sri Lanka with 63 of them coming in one match.
