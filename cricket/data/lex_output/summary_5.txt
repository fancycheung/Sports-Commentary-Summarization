The guys have gelled well and we have come out of two close games.We have been 0-4 down in the last two T20 series we have played against them.No pace on this shortish ball angled away, Watt was looking to play to third man but not as fine.Ekes an outside edge while trying to upper-cut and it runs away19 off the last over..18.6Panyangara to Mark Watt, 1 run, another slower ball banged in,

the leg-side, Mommsen knived his bat forward and paddled it away to short fine10.2S Raza to Mommsen, FOUR, comes down the track and digests the flight on this ball with a loft over mid-on.I think we have lost wickets at the wrong time.I think they bowled well.Low full toss and just outside off, Chigumbura clears his front leg and looks to bury it over the fielder at extra cover, but can't get the connection right.In the end, the right decision made18.2Davey to W Masakadza, 1 run, very full and this time, Davey shifts his line to outside off, Masakadza somehow squeezes it out to cover for a

to Sibanda, 1 run, a little too straight from Davey and Sibanda is content with a modest push-drive down to long-on1.4Davey to Sibanda, no run, this is much better from Davey.The keeper is up to the stumps."Masakadza: "We are going to bat first.Unfortunately, we couldn't get over the line" - Preston Mommsen.
